Any contraption they touch always seems to break down – and always at the worst possible moment. It could be anything – trains run out of steam, clockwork mechanisms throw springs; it seems that anything more complicated than a coin toss just won’t work when they are around. They are constantly haunted by the sound of escaping steam, backlit by spitting sparks, and engulfed by broiling smoke. They can’t even wear a pocket watch. And worse, there is no upside to this condition. A hero with this Hindrance can’t simply put his palms on the control panel of the death-ray and watch it blow itself to Kingdom Come. If anything, his presence will simply speed up the countdown to disaster.","notes":"The Widening GyreThe Widening Gyre page 22","additionalStats":{},"major":true},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"UeH4lLk57wAOn2HV":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.the-widening-gyre.axEUz32UNlNducSE"},"cf":{"id":"temp_6q123tv11oh","path":"The Widening Gyre","color":"#000000"}},"_id":"i4zKuviFlYvatlxz"}

You follow proper protocols at all times. This has good and bad points – on the plus side, you’ve got a +2 bonus to Spirit rolls to resist influences that might distract you from your duties. The downside is that you’re a stickler for following written instructions and official policy – if you disobey the orders of a superior officer, breach the rules of your organization, or even skip the boring paperwork, the Game Master can decide that it costs you bennies.<p><b>Note:</b> Cannot be taken with the Impulsive Hindrance.</p><p><b>Source: </b>Pulp Fantastic, page 76","notes":"Pulp Fantastic, page 76","additionalStats":{},"major":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"UeH4lLk57wAOn2HV":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_wnkgkcgakkj","path":"Pulp Fantastic","color":"#000000"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.jd-weird-world.jd-weird-world-hindrances.L0e2NQlOOeZnE3E6"}},"_id":"Gub6VFkn8WNpRZ7D"}

{"name":"Depression","type":"hindrance","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/hindrance.svg","data":{"description":"Your character’s emotional problems make the very act of living a chore. Symptoms include sleep problems (either oversleeping or insomnia), severe procrastination (to the point that the sufferer may find it hard to hold down a job), and a lack of interest in anything. With anti-depressant drugs (limited to opioids and amphetamines during the Pulp era) there is no penalty, and this is a Minor Hindrance. Without drugs this is a Major Hindrance and characters suffer a −2 to most tasks and tend to avoid getting involved. A life-threatening crisis or shock may snap the character out of it for a while, but when the crisis is over, the character sinks back into inactivity afterwards. <p><b>Note: </b>Characters with this Hindrance during the Pulp era are at risk of becoming addicted to their medication (a Major Habit Hindrance), as non-addictive anti-depression drugs won’t be discovered until the 1950s.</p><p><b>Source: </b>Pulp Fantastic, page 77","notes":"Pulp Fantastic, page 77","additionalStats":{},"major":true},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"UeH4lLk57wAOn2HV":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_wnkgkcgakkj","path":"Pulp Fantastic","color":"#000000"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.jd-weird-world.jd-weird-world-hindrances.7mjPxHTnjwTNWEAx"}},"_id":"y6WJpbRulaHy7dUF"}

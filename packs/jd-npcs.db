You can bond with a warbeast that has been properly trained to respond to you. Once bonded, you have a mental link to the warbeast, allowing you to give it commands and share its senses. It’s also much more effective in everything it does, and can roll your Wild Die on any action as long as it is within your control area (1” x the sum of your Smarts and Spirit dice). You may spend your Bennies on your warbeast’s behalf. Additionally, you may push the warbeast beyond its normal limits to draw upon its magical potential. This is risky, however, and has a chance of driving the beast into a murderous frenzy.</p><p> To use this ability, choose how many Power Points you want to draw from your warbeast, to a maximum of half the warbeast’s Spirit die. You gain that many Power Points immediately (before the roll). You roll your arcane skill opposed by the warbeast’s Spirit. The warbeast gains a +1 bonus to this roll for each Power Point you gained. If the warbeast wins the opposed roll, it is Shaken. If the warbeast gets a raise on the roll, it goes berserk (as the Edge) and attacks the nearest creature on its action. To regain control of a warbeast, you must roll an opposed arcane skill check against its Spirit while it’s within your control area as an action. If you succeed, it is no longer berserk and is under your control again. Each time you reave power from a warbeast, it gains a +2 bonus on Spirit rolls to resist your control for 24 hours.","notes":"Iron Kingdoms Conversion","additionalStats":[],"isArcaneBackground":false,"requirements":{"value":"Arcane Background (any), Wild Card, may not possess the Warcaster edge"}},"_id":"sh4c0aa35ramyks2","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"UeH4lLk57wAOn2HV":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.iron-kingdoms.RQ4LfMwjTiGNLio9"},"cf":{"id":"temp_og0np7k2v8","path":"Fantasy Edges#/CF_SEP/Iron Kingdoms","color":"#000000"}}},{"type":"edge","name":"Tough As Nails","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/edge.svg","data":{"description":"<div class=\"swade-core\">\n<p>Your character keeps going when others fall.

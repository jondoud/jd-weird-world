{"_id":"8lEjzR51RsjQTKYS","name":"National Identity","type":"edge","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/edge.svg","data":{"description":"The soldiers of each nation in the Great War had an “identity” associated with them. Americans were “lucky,” British were “plucky,” and the Russians seemed fatalistic for most of the conflict. Soldiers with this Edge make this identity iconic by choosing one of the special abilities below. Characters from other nations can choose any of these abilities with the approval of the WM. • ANZAC Camaraderie: The troops from Australia and New Zealand defined the identity of their people by facing the tremendous casualties and horrible conditions during the Gallipoli campaign with their unique concept of “mateship,” reflecting the qualities of loyalty, equality, and friendship. ANZAC troops add +2 to Spirit rolls if adjacent to an ally.</p><p>• British Pluck: The British “stiff upper lip” made them incredibly resilient under even the most dreadful circumstances. “Tommys” add +2 to Spirit rolls made to resist Fear and Intimidation. It does not add to Spirit rolls to recover from being Shaken.</p><p>• Canadian Heart: As Britain’s largest Dominion, Canada was an important part of the Allied war effort. Canadian soldiers are eager to prove themselves, and get +4 on Trait and damage rolls when dealt a Joker rather than +2.</p><p>• French Élan: The French Army began the war planning to attack along the whole front, relying on French fighting spirit to overcome the enemy’s superior numbers. Even after the debacle of the first weeks, some of that spirit remained. If a Frenchman with this Edge spends a Benny to make a Trait roll, his Wild Die increases one die type, usually to a d8. This is different from the Elan Edge (see Savage Worlds), though the two work together for particularly proud individuals.</p><p>• German Efficiency: German troops get some of the best training in Europe. A character with this Edge treats all Trait requirements for Combat Edges as one die type less, though Rank requirements remain the same.</p><p>• Russian Fatalism: Many Russians seemed resigned to inevitable suffering, whether in the trenches, in captivity, or dealing with shortages at home. Yet they struggled on, until one disaster too many sparked revolt. Russian characters with this Edge ignore one level of wound modifier, which stacks with Nerves of Steel and Improved Nerves of Steel.</p><p>• US Luck: The American Doughboys joined the war to “make the world safe for democracy” and certainly appeared to have fortune or fate on their side. As evidenced by Sgt. York, “Yanks” would sometimes succeed at near impossible tasks. Whenever the character spends a Benny to make a roll, he ignores up to −2 points of penalties. Upper Class Requirements: Novice Your character is “well-born” and may have a noble title, or be heir to one. In the early 20th century, the prerequisites of nobility aren’t as impressive as they once were. Upper Class characters get a +1 Charisma bonus whenever dealing with other aristocrats or with lower-class individuals from their own society who support the traditional order. They get a −1 Charisma penalty when interacting with revolutionaries and others who support social change. Upper Class characters don’t get any bonus to wealth, but they do have connections to the “Establishment” which can give them some minor special privileges. A junior officer of “good family” might wind up being invited to dine with the General and his staff, and is more likely to be given a sympathetic hearing if he goes outside the rules. American characters can’t take this Edge.","notes":"Weird War I","additionalStats":[],"isArcaneBackground":false,"requirements":{"value":"21"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"RX3k8ETYyqlbZDTC":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.weird-war-i-edges.T1lxeDrmAtZubQkr"},"cf":{"id":"temp_6j8uzj9fx9s","path":"Weird War I","color":"#000000"}}}

Should they critically fail such a roll, they suffer the effect of a major sin (complete loss of powers for a week and –4 to “normal” uses of the Perform skill). This represents terrible strain on their voice, mind, or raw nerves for the given period. The Perform skill may also be used simply to entertain instead of activating powers. In these cases, the Troubadour can earn money for his performance. A successful skill roll per “set” (usually a couple of hours) nets him $1d6 for every 10 members of the audience. Double this number with a raise. The performer may add his Charisma to the roll when using the skill in this way. This assumes the audience can tip instead of a set fee.

You gain that many Power Points immediately (before the roll). You roll your arcane skill opposed by the warbeast’s Spirit. The warbeast gains a +1 bonus to this roll for each Power Point you gained. If the warbeast wins the opposed roll, it is Shaken. If the warbeast gets a raise on the roll, it goes berserk (as the Edge) and attacks the nearest creature on its action. To regain control of a warbeast, you must roll an opposed arcane skill check against its Spirit while it’s within your control area as an action.

{"_id":"Y1jrOoZarcwX46Pz","name":"Haunted","type":"edge","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/edge.svg","data":{"description":"Haunted heroes have a helpful but occasionally frightening spirit companion. Perhaps the ghost is the protective brother who didn’t survive the stand at the Marne. Or maybe the apparition of some long-dead warrior manifests to relive the glory of his past military deeds through his descendant.</p><p>On taking this Edge, first decide on the specter’s origin and write out enough backstory that the War Master knows how to play it. The spirit then grants your hero one of the abilities below (your choice) Future advances may add additional abilities.</p><p>The space between worlds is difficult for the phantom, so it never communicates directly. Instead it takes over equipment, tunes in odd radio messages, or scratches warnings in dirt or in the fog of a window. A spirit with the Danger Sense ability, for example, might make your warrior trip and fall into a shell crater just before a French machine gun rips up the battlefield.</p><p>Beast Ward: Animals instantly sense Haunted characters. Hostile animals focus on them where possible, but attack at −2. Roll a die with domesticated creatures. On an even number the animal can be handled (ridden, etc.) at a −2 penalty. Odd, the animal attacks savagely or refuses to be handled.</p><p>Backlash: Unfortunately, the link with the phantom can occasionally have terrifying results. Whenever the character suffers a Fatigue level or wound that isn’t soaked, he momentarily glimpses the dark things lurking in the spirit world and must make a Spirit roll. If the roll is failed, he loses a Sanity point (2 with a critical failure) and is Shaken (this cannot cause a wound).</p><p>Haunted Abilities: Choose one of the abilities below at character creation. You may add additional abilities with advances.</p><p>• Arcane Resistance: Per the Edge. Taking this ability a second time grants the hero Improved Arcane Resistance. The ability typically manifests as a spectral aura about the host.</p><p>• Channeling: The spirit channels its previous abilities into its host, perhaps whispering near- insane ramblings in his mind or ear. Once per session, and for the duration of a scene or encounter, the specter grants the character a +4 bonus to any non-combat skill the War Master believes would have been known by the spirit. Thus the ghost of a thief might give its host a bonus to Lockpicking, while a Civil War cavalry officer might aid Riding.</p><p>• Danger Sense: Per the Edge. The ghost communicates in eerie and mysterious ways. Perhaps it flashes horrible visions of the coming carnage, or drops a cold spot on the host. If the character has Danger Sense on his own, this ability grants two chances to detect ambushes or other unseen attacks.</p><p>• Fear: Anyone who attacks the host in close combat gets a glimpse of the angry spirit that protects him and must make a Fear test. Once passed, the test need not be made again.</p><p>• Guardian Angel: The spirit grants the character an extra Benny per session that can only be used to soak damage.</p><p>• Poltergeist: The spirit spends a great amount of energy to affect dozens of small objects in a Large Burst Template within sight of the host. Foes within must make a Spirit test or be Shaken unless they have a personal Armor value of 4 or more. The exhausted spirit cannot act again for 24 hours afterward.</p><p>• Possession: By spending a Benny and taking a Fatigue level for 24 hours, the host can send the specter to possess a human target in line of sight. The victim is under the control of the spirit until it breaks free (Spirit roll at −2 each round). This doesn’t change the nature of the ghost—it’s still a distant, angry spirit with few cogent thoughts—but it can make its host perform basic tasks such as giving orders in his own language, attack, or operate machinery. The host will never deliberately commit suicide.</p><p>• Reaper Ward: As the host lies dying, the spirit fights off the swirling reapers that would come to claim his soul. Roll a die. If the result is odd, the spirit loses and is torn asunder along with the host’s soul. If the die is even, the protective spirit wins the fight and the hero lives, though he is Incapacitated.</p><p>• Séance: The spirit can speak with other dead souls and attempt to gain information from them. With serious effort (total concentration and a Fatigue level lasting 24 hours) and contact with a corpse, a character can force the specter to concentrate enough to speak with the corpse’s spirit and ask a single question. The spirit answers only what it knows, and even this is often vague. A dead soldier might know he was shot by a German, for example, but wouldn’t know the soldier’s name unless he or his companions spoke it in the body’s presence. This information manifests in brief but terrifying visions in the host’s mind, causing a Fear test at −2.</p><p>• Vehicular Animation: The spirit enters the machinery of a vehicle and imbues it with supernatural energy. All crewmen add +2 to any vehicular actions (including firing its weapons), and attacks against it suffer a −2 penalty. This occurs one round after combat rounds begin and lasts until the War Master declares the game is no longer in rounds. The ability covers an entire vehicle, even an entire ship and all its crew, if directed. This exhausts the spirit, which can take no other action for 24 hours.","notes":"Weird War I","additionalStats":[],"isArcaneBackground":false,"requirements":{"value":"26"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"RX3k8ETYyqlbZDTC":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.weird-war-i-edges.6lX6EjhSdZHOmmvG"},"cf":{"id":"temp_6j8uzj9fx9s","path":"Weird War I","color":"#000000"}}}

The cost of the swarm trap is the same as the normal casting cost. A swarm trap is where part of a swarm lie in wait for something to come within its radius of affect. This is either the spell's normal effect or small blast template, whichever is larger. Spells that have a range can typically be used as a swarm trap.</p>\n<p>The caster stands at the center of the desired area of effect and casts the spell as normal. However, it does not go off immediately as the swarm simply stands in place waiting to be triggered. The swarm trap lasts as long as the caster stays within the range of the spell (for example, 2 x smarts for Blast) or dismissed. The caster may decide when the swarm triggers by setting a condition( for example, \"Someone enters the room\", \"Three bandits are by the tree\"). However, if the mage wishes to trigger the trap before the condition is met, the triggering uses the same rules as someone on Hold performing an Interrupting Action (Nano&shy;Mages also need to have Athletics to be successful).

The caster decides it is best to be careful and uses the Selective (+1 point for a total of 3 points) modifier to only affect the Bandits. The mage decides to trigger the trap when three bandits enter the blast radius of the Power. After casting, the Mage moves away 6 paces. Two Bandits stop to fire their pistols and another runs into the radius of the Blast Power. Since none of the bandits triggered the spell last round, the Mage decides to move another 4 paces and maintains the trap. Since he is within his Smarts X 2 (d10 Smarts) range of the Blast Power, the trap remains in effect. This round another bandit advanced into the blass area. The Mage decides to trigger the trap immediately instead of waiting for the condition to be met. The Mage rolls a 10 for Athletics check. The Bandits roll only a 5 and the swarm's Blast effect is triggered before the bandits can react. The Bandits take 2d6 damage! Now they know there is a Mage to contend with! </em></p>\n<p>A swarm trap cannot be noticed or detected under normal circumstances (the GM may decide if Detect Arcana will discover traps).

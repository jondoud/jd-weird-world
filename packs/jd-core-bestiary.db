Twisted albino dwarves with swollen heads and pupil-less eyes, the Dero are sadistic psychic cannibals who delight in the degradation and torture of surface life. The Dero are immortal, as long as they avoid direct sunlight; solar radiation causes them extreme discomfort and causes them to age normally. They skulk in the caverns once excavated by their distant ancestors, surrounded by advanced technology they no longer remember how to use, using their psychic talents to amplify mankind’s basest urges.   Colonies of Dero can be found all over the globe, preying on those humans who exist on the fringes of society. They use their psionic abilities to appear human while hunting on the surface, luring the unwary to isolated places where they can be put to sleep and carried below ground to await a fate truly worse than death. When not feasting on human flesh or tormenting human prisoners, the Dero band together to use the collective power of their minds to create natural disasters, accidents and wars, delighting in the carnage they inflict on humanity.<br/>

These gigantic creatures are typified by long necks, long tails, massive bodies and four sturdy legs. Herbivores, they feed on high-growth plant matter, stripping tree-tops to fuel their bulk. Some can even rear up on their hind legs to reach higher growth despite weighing more than a blue whale, shaking the earth when they drop back to all fours. Adult sauropods can reach 60 ft high, 190 f) long and weigh as much as 73 tons.<br/> Sauropods vary very little in basic structure and only naturalists bother to distinguish the various species. Despite being herbivores, sauropods fear very little, being massive enough to crush most predators flat. When provoked, sauropods can crack their enormously long tails like a whip, with the tip travelling faster than a bullet.<br/> Sauropods communicate over vast distances using subsonic song, generated inside the massive body and transmitted through the ground via the leg bones. Sauropods communicate with others in their herd using an audible version of the same sound, highly reminiscent of whale song. They are social animals, gathering in large herds. Within the herd the animals are segregated by age, with the smaller juveniles forming smaller sub-herds away from the adults, possibly to avoid crushing accidents. Sauropod herds frequent lightly forested plains and grasslands, feeding from the canopy on the forest edge, as well as wetlands and coastal areas.<br/> Unlike most herbivores, sauropods are curious and not easily startled. Their massive size and power mean that they have few natural predators, and even carnosaurs like tyrannosaurus rex will hesitate at   taking on a 56-ton brachiosaurus. When presented with something novel, most sauropods will simply stare at it for a while before returning to their grazing.<br/> "},"species":{"name":""},"archetype":"","currency":500,"wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Novice","details":""},"bennies":{"value":0,"max":0},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":false},"token":{"disposition":-1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"displayName":0,"width":8,"height":8,"scale":1,"name":"Sauropod","actorLink":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","actorId":null},"items":[{"type":"skill","name":"Athletics","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":true,"die":{"sides":10,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"o0if6pkocisdb7j0","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"skill","name":"Fighting","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":10,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"7y1gmfiumjjc1sft","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"skill","name":"Notice","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":true,"die":{"sides":12,"modifier":4},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"ktu3aamar2fhe11j","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"skill","name":"Survival","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":12,"modifier":4},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"8t0lquub6tihk0fv","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"edge","name":"Sweep","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/edge.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"isArcaneBackground":false,"requirements":{"value":""}},"_id":"bnrfzp0usrr7tz2z","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"edge","name":"Improved Sweep","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/edge.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"isArcaneBackground":false,"requirements":{"value":""}},"_id":"af0om29hg9ws4ner","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"edge","name":"Strong Willed","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/edge.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"isArcaneBackground":false,"requirements":{"value":""}},"_id":"8sq2b812c16tehm9","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"edge","name":"Trademark Weapon (Tail)","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/edge.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"isArcaneBackground":false,"requirements":{"value":""}},"_id":"sokqdgp74t9v7f3w","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"armor","name":"Armor +3","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/armor.svg","data":{"description":"Thick hide.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"equippable":true,"equipped":true,"isArcaneDevice":false,"arcaneSkillDie":{"sides":4,"modifier":0},"powerPoints":{},"actions":{"skill":"","skillMod":"","dmgMod":"","additional":{}},"minStr":"","armor":3,"toughness":0,"isNaturalArmor":false,"locations":{"head":false,"torso":true,"arms":false,"legs":false}},"_id":"461yqxp2p61cv7es","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"ability","name":"Hardy","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"A second Shaken result doesn’t become a wound.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"z7n33epuye9r9704","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"ability","name":"Huge","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"–4 to attack medium – sized foes;

Pteranodons have an elongated skull crest and a pointed beak. The crest is used to provide additional stability during flight and is flushed with color for mating displays, while their long beaks are used to spear prey such as fish, insects and other small animals.<br/> Pteranodons hunt in flocks and gather together in large rookeries on cliff faces and mountainsides. They like to swoop on their prey, either spearing it with their beak or in the case of larger prey, grabbing it with their feet and dropping it from a height to kill or stun it. Pteranodons prefer coastal areas where they can hunt for fish but can be found anywhere that they can build their nests and rookeries. Inland they are most often found in mountainous areas.<br/> Pteranodons are opportunistic predators and will attack anything smaller than them. Anything larger and more fast moving will prompt a swift retreat to the air.<br/> "},"species":{"name":""},"archetype":"","currency":500,"wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":0,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Novice","details":""},"bennies":{"value":0,"max":0},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":false},"token":{"disposition":-1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"displayName":0,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"name":"Pteranodon","actorLink":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","actorId":null},"items":[{"type":"skill","name":"Athletics","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":true,"die":{"sides":8,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"zacoewbl20llzmdd","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"skill","name":"Fighting","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":6,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"xbg5z5zbe6r4z80j","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"skill","name":"Notice","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":true,"die":{"sides":10,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"nm42cd8pwbf8wr5z","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"armor","name":"Armor +1","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/armor.svg","data":{"description":"Scaly hide.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"equippable":true,"equipped":true,"isArcaneDevice":false,"arcaneSkillDie":{"sides":4,"modifier":0},"powerPoints":{},"actions":{"skill":"","skillMod":"","dmgMod":"","additional":{}},"minStr":"","armor":1,"toughness":0,"isNaturalArmor":false,"locations":{"head":false,"torso":true,"arms":false,"legs":false}},"_id":"87eulnx7nbeqo2qq","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"weapon","name":"Bite/claw","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/weapon.svg","data":{"description":"Str+d6.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"equippable":true,"equipped":true,"isArcaneDevice":false,"arcaneSkillDie":{"sides":4,"modifier":0},"powerPoints":{},"isVehicular":false,"mods":1,"actions":{"skill":"Fighting","skillMod":"","dmgMod":"","additional":{}},"damage":"@str+d6","range":"","rof":1,"ap":0,"parry":0,"minStr":"","shots":0,"currentShots":0,"ammo":"","autoReload":false},"_id":"0wrzz86zk1ndvf3x","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"ability","name":"Flight","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Pteranodons have a Flying Pace of 12”, with an Acceleration of 3”.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"w5zci42zn5mwfgqh","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"ability","name":"Fly-By Attack","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"When the pteranodon is flying at fully speed, it can do a fly-by attack, getting a +2 to damage.

In adult krakens, these scales carry large accretions of mollusks and other marine life.<br/> It is unknown what krakens hunt in their natural habitat, but they have been reported attacking whales, ships, submarines and occasionally even coastal communities.

Ceratopsian species include Protoceratops, Triceratops, Machairoceratops,   Pentaceratops, Diabloceratops, Styracosaurus and Einosaurus, most distinguished by the number of facial and or brow horns they possess.<br/> Ceratopsians all share a stocky, sturdy build, with a stout body, four strong limbs and a short tail. Adults average between 26 – 29.5 ft long, 8.2 – 9.8 ft high and weigh between 6.5 and 13 tons. Though stocky and powerfully built, ceratopsians can move with quickly when provoked, and will charge a foe at speeds of up to 40 mph. The neck frill and horns of the ceratopsians protect them against predators, and the frills can be flushed with blood in courtship displays.<br/> Ceratopsians graze on shrubs and low-lying plants, occasionally rearing up to reach tasty morsels at higher levels. They are eating machines, devouring huge volumes of palms, ferns cycads and other vegetation. Ceratopsians prefer prairies, grasslands and savannahs, where they can scent the approach of predators, but can also be found in light forests.<br/> Ceratopsians are stupid, territorial and aggressive, especially during the mating season, and later when their young have hatched. While they will tolerate intruders at a distance, approaching too close to a herd will usually prompt a threat display of bellowing and pawing the ground from the dominant male, followed by a charge.<br/>

Perhaps the best-known raptor is the Deinonychus (“Terrible Claw”), named for the over-sized sickle-shaped claw on each foot, which it uses to horrific effect for disemboweling and clinging on to prey. Intelligent, aggressive and virtually fearless, raptors prey on large herbivores, leaping onto their prey and latching on with their claws while delivering powerful, tearing bites.<br/> All raptors use their long tails for balance while running and leaping, and can use their claws to help them climb trees or other obstacles. Their eyesight is keen and highly sensitive to moving objects, and their eyes are located high on their heads, enabling them to spy on prey from cover without exposing themselves. Raptors have an exceptional sense of smell, allowing them to track prey even when it isn’t visible.<br/> Like wolves, these dinosaurs hunt in packs, but are adaptable enough to feed on carrion if live prey is not available. Like most pack predators, they prefer to pick off lone or otherwise vulnerable targets but are intelligent enough to use ambushes and herding tactics when required. They can communicate in a rudimentary fashion with each other through clicks and hisses and possess fore-claws dexterous enough to hold and examine objects, and even operate door handles. Raptors usually exhibit intelligence and curiosity, and learn quickly, something which has led to an unpleasant end to any foolish enough to underestimate them. Some may even be on the verge of using tools and developing true intelligence...<br/> Note: Raptors are closely related to birds, and many subspecies were either partially or completely feathered.<br/>

The distinctive back plates provide protection and can be flushed with blood for threat and mating displays. They also help the animal with thermoregulation by providing additional cooling surface. Adults average 30 ft in length and 13 ft tall, and weigh about 4.5 tons.<br/> Stegosaurs are low-level grazers, though they will occasionally rear up on their hind legs to reach higher growth. Stegosaurs are ruminants, with broad, flat teeth designed to grind and chew vegetation behind a horny beak (rhamphotheca) designed to strip leaves from branches. Stegosaurs are about as intelligent as a cow, and are generally placid beasts, though wary of possible threats, especially during calving season. They are notoriously shortsighted and can easily be spooked by rapid movement in their peripheral visual field.<br/> They are generally found grazing on upland plains, away from the coast and forest areas where predators might lurk. Naturally wary, stegosaurs become highly alert to possible threats during the mating season and when their calves are young and vulnerable. They are quite shortsighted and generally react to rapid movement but have a well- developed sense of smell. If approached slowly and carefully they will tolerate humans up to a point, but they are very stupid and can easily kill by accident. Rapid movement in their peripheral vision can startle them into delivering a crushing blow with their spiked tail.<br/> If startled, stegosaurs will flush their dorsal plates bright red with blood, paw the ground and bellow as a threat display. When threatened by a large predator, stegosaurs hunker down and turn their back, relying on the bone-breaking power of their heavily muscled spiked tail to drive off any attacker. When travelling with calves, adult stegosaurs form a protective circle around their young and thrash their tails.<br/> "},"species":{"name":""},"archetype":"","currency":500,"wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":1,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Novice","details":""},"bennies":{"value":0,"max":0},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":false},"token":{"disposition":-1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"displayName":0,"width":4,"height":4,"scale":1,"name":"Stegosaurus","actorLink":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","actorId":null},"items":[{"type":"skill","name":"Fighting","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":8,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"t0ihkfksz237mfze","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"skill","name":"Notice","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":true,"die":{"sides":12,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"mrxbsxjr4qqhc32s","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"skill","name":"Survival","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":12,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"l519ab8h2u4arr81","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"edge","name":"Level Headed","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/edge.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"isArcaneBackground":false,"requirements":{"value":""}},"_id":"c0wwdigjy4me7tzz","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"edge","name":"Sweep","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/edge.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"isArcaneBackground":false,"requirements":{"value":""}},"_id":"gjw12zj9ig7sklyx","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"edge","name":"Trademark Weapon (Tail)","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/edge.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"isArcaneBackground":false,"requirements":{"value":""}},"_id":"dbfkkpkoxuv0u3i3","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"armor","name":"Armor +3","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/armor.svg","data":{"description":"Thick hide.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"equippable":true,"equipped":true,"isArcaneDevice":false,"arcaneSkillDie":{"sides":4,"modifier":0},"powerPoints":{},"actions":{"skill":"","skillMod":"","dmgMod":"","additional":{}},"minStr":"","armor":3,"toughness":0,"isNaturalArmor":false,"locations":{"head":false,"torso":true,"arms":false,"legs":false}},"_id":"p1k87yb1bjgrp8zx","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"ability","name":"Hardy","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"A second Shaken result doesn’t become a wound.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"f98ts2d7dnoye4x0","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"weapon","name":"Knockback","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/weapon.svg","data":{"description":"Opponent knocked back d8” on a raise;

Other similar dinosaurs include Gorgosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Albertosaurus.<br/> Tyrannosaurs are hunters, opportunistic carnivores that run down and kill their prey, then gorge on the flesh, often returning to the kill for days at a time. Prey animals include everything from smaller herbivores to big sauropods.<br/> The most successful and well-known family of therapod carnivores, the tyrannosaurs (tyrant lizards) dominate the dinosaur landscape. Tyrannosaurs come in a variety of sizes and colors, depending on environmental factors and the amount of food available. Some – like Tyrannosaurus rex and Giganotosaurus – are huge, up to 40 ft long, 12 ft high at the hips and weighing a colossal 9.5 tons. Tyrannosaurs continue to grow throughout their life, and while few live beyond thirty years due to the violence of their lives, some lost worlds and anomalous regions are dominated by truly monstrous ancient beasts.<br/> Tyrannosaurs have good binocular vision and a tremendously well-developed sense of smell, making them formidable hunters and ambush predators. Their powerful legs allow them to run at 45 mph – as fast as an Olympic sprinter – and they can leap almost double their own length given enough space. Their teeth are roughly the size of modern bananas and are designed for tearing off 500-600 lb. chunks of meat which are then swallowed whole.<br/> A tyrannosaur bite can kill even if not immediately fatal; the teeth have tiny serrations in which bacteria thrive, leading to the virulent infection of any wound inflicted. When faced with large prey, a tyrannosaur can inflict a bite wound, and then simply follow the animal until it collapses due to the infection.<br/> Tyrannosaurs have an incredibly powerful bite force, in excess of 23 tons – enough to bite through a family car. This enables them to devour the entire carcass of a kill, bones and all, though they will do this over a period of days, sleeping off a meal before returning to eat more.<br/> Far from being the stupid, short-sighted creatures portrayed in fiction, time, tyrannosaurs are highly intelligent. As smart as a chimp, a tyrannosaur can develop strategies for dealing with difficult prey and complex situations. They learn quickly, and while they are normally solitary hunters, they will occasionally cooperate with others of their own kind to bring down troublesome or well-protected prey.<br/>   Their often-mocked small forearms are incredibly strong, capable of lifting over 500 lbs. each. These limbs are used in mating and to help secure struggling prey while the powerful jaws tear off chunks of flesh.<br/> Adult tyrannosaurs are solitary creatures outside of the mating and young rearing stages. In the mating seasons they gather together in large groups, where the males display and compete for mating rights to the females. During this time, they are particularly aggressive and dangerous, as males will often seek prey to present to the females as gifts. Many tyrannosaur males are wounded during fights for dominance, though they are extremely robust and can survive injuries that would be fatal to almost any other animal, including traumatic brain injuries. Once mating has been successful and the egg clutches have been laid, the females and males cover them with dung to keep them warm during their incubation.<br/> The males then hunt for food while the female guards the nest from opportunistic egg thieves. Once the young have hatched the females drive the males away until the next mating cycle.<br/> Young tyrannosaurs hunt in packs in the same way as raptors but are eventually driven off or eaten by the females once they reach maturity.<br/> Tyrannosaurs can adapt to a variety of different environments. They prefer forests and jungles, however, where their coloration and ability to sprint after prey at surprising speeds puts them at an advantage.<br/> Tyrannosaurs are aggressive, intelligent apex predators, and very little can intimidate them. Unless it has recently fed, a tyrannosaur’s response to a threat is to chase it, catch it and eat it.

It distorts reality simply by existing, causing insanity, death and... worse. In ages past it and its kind ruled the world – they may have even made the world and everything in it. Even us.<br/> Their minds are beyond human understanding, their motives utterly incomprehensible. Even their bodies cannot be seen without twisting the minds of the viewer, imparting horrific insights into the true nature of the universe and the place of mankind within it. Eldritch Abominations often don’t even show up in the stories that mention them, but their shadow touches everything. Often worshipped as gods by primitive cultures and seekers of wisdom driven insane by their delving into the forbidden, they sometimes gift their supplicants with knowledge of an alien science so bizarre and arcane that it may have formed the mythological basis for what we today call magic.<br/> Obscure legends from before the age when man walked upright hint that these elder horrors slithered down from the stars before the dinosaurs arose. They built mighty cities so alien that they warped space and time around them, fought terrible wars and made unholy alliances. How they lost their grip on the world is unknown. Some legends hint that God and His angels cast them out, while others claim that there is no God and that they were banished by things kinder but no less alien. Others yet claim that they were overcome by the powers of proto-human magician priests, or that they were the victims of a cosmological shift – an event soon to reverse itself and allow them purchase in the world of man once more.<br/> Many greater abominations lie trapped outside normal space, hungering in the awful outer darkness between universes, while other lesser creatures slumber in alien tombs and monstrous cities lost beneath the earth or at the bottom of the sea. Others still lurk beyond gateways to distant worlds or hibernate in the depths of deep space, waiting for the call to awaken and feed on minds and souls once more.<br/> Physically, Eldritch Abominations come in a variety of forms, from almost human to physically impossible, from living gases and spatial distortions to writhing masses of tentacles, eyes, tooth-filled maws and wings. Many simply cannot be seen at all, while others are so utterly alien that simply to see and comprehend them means madness or death for the viewer.<br/> As terrible and horrific as these beings are, the greatest threat comes not from them, but from the madmen and fanatics that worship them as gods. There is little evidence to suggest these monstrosities even notice their supplicants, but this does not stop demented cults and sects forming around their legend and working towards hastening the moment of their release into a shocked and screaming world. Such cults are usually debased and utterly beyond reason, practicing perverted and depraved rites and ceremonies, stopping at nothing to secure the freedom of their terrible gods. These cults are often gifted with arcane powers and vile mutations, gifted either deliberately by the Eldritch Abominations or merely as a side-effect of getting   too close to something so unfathomably alien that the universe itself protests at their presence.<br/> Note: For the best examples of Eldritch Abominations from the Pulps, we recommend reading the works of H.P. Lovecraft and his associates, which provided much of the inspiration for this section. We recommend that they not form the basis of the campaign though – if you want to do that there are other games far better suited and with a wealth of published supporting material. Instead they should be used sparingly, as ultimate threats, lurking in the thoughts of your players as their characters explore subterranean temples or investigate dark cults, limited to casting twisted shadows on the walls of reality lest they overwhelm your campaign.<br/> We present no stats for the greater Eldritch Abominations. They are creatures from the outer darkness, defined by their disdain for the rules of our reality. Put simply, they are gods – living plot devices – and they ignore the rules that affect lesser creatures. Meeting one face to gibbering maw is something no sane character should ever want to happen. The stats below can be applied to the lesser Abominations; the creatures that slumber beneath the earth and sea, occasionally roused by intrusion into their forbidden temples and lost cities.<br/> "},"species":{"name":""},"archetype":"","currency":500,"wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":3,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Novice","details":""},"bennies":{"value":0,"max":0},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":false},"token":{"disposition":-1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"displayName":0,"width":16,"height":16,"scale":1,"name":"Eldritch Abomination","actorLink":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","actorId":null},"items":[{"type":"skill","name":"Fighting","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":10,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"48n3s8bykfk7kjdp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"edge","name":"Unkillable","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/edge.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"isArcaneBackground":false,"requirements":{"value":""}},"_id":"bak4z507rga1mnu1","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"armor","name":"Armor +5","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/armor.svg","data":{"description":"The obscene flesh of Eldritch Abomina- tions is thick and rubbery.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"equippable":true,"equipped":true,"isArcaneDevice":false,"arcaneSkillDie":{"sides":4,"modifier":0},"powerPoints":{},"actions":{"skill":"","skillMod":"","dmgMod":"","additional":{}},"minStr":"","armor":5,"toughness":0,"isNaturalArmor":false,"locations":{"head":false,"torso":true,"arms":false,"legs":false}},"_id":"0kmgtkv657bl8w61","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"weapon","name":"Bite","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/weapon.svg","data":{"description":"The gaping, grinding maw of an Eldritch Abomination does Str+d8 damage.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"equippable":true,"equipped":true,"isArcaneDevice":false,"arcaneSkillDie":{"sides":4,"modifier":0},"powerPoints":{},"isVehicular":false,"mods":1,"actions":{"skill":"Fighting","skillMod":"","dmgMod":"","additional":{}},"damage":"@str+d8","range":"","rof":1,"ap":0,"parry":0,"minStr":"","shots":0,"currentShots":0,"ammo":"","autoReload":false},"_id":"aialup61txe10iza","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"ability","name":"Environmental Resistance","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"As a dweller between the stars, Eldritch Abominations take no damage from heat, cold or vacuum.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"2cf3gyaz5b5xo3cy","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"ability","name":"Fast Regeneration","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Eldritch Abominations make a Vigor roll each round to heal wounds. +2 to recover from Shaken.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"kfhtdon6yesjysck","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"ability","name":"Fear (-8)","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Characters who see an Eldritch Abomi- nation must make a Fear check at -8.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"tufpug66oqrtldm9","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"ability","name":"Fearless","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Immune to Fear and Intimidation.

It has a short head with a mouthful of needle-sharp teeth and normally lives on a diet of insects. However, when they scent blood, they become frenzied and swarm their prey in a whirlwind of teeth and wings, stripping most animals to the bones in minutes.<br/> Anurognathus can be found on the Maple White Land plateau and in the jungles of Skull Island, as well as the forests of hidden valleys and subterranean lost lands.

Physically, they resemble albino gorillas, with pale gray fur and yellow eyes, though they have greatly deformed skulls and a mass and height more closely resembling humans. White Apes are naturally cunning and intelligent, and some evidence exists to suggest that they’re capable of strategic planning and tactical coordination. They communicate with a primitive language of grunts and howls, and have been observed using tools such as clubs, spears and even simple armor. White Apes are found only in the most remote areas of the African continent, inhabiting the ruined cities of lost civilizations, violently guarding their territory against all intruders.<br/> "},"species":{"name":""},"archetype":"","currency":500,"wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":0,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Novice","details":""},"bennies":{"value":0,"max":0},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":false},"token":{"disposition":-1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"displayName":0,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"name":"Ape, White","actorLink":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","actorId":null},"items":[{"type":"skill","name":"Athletics","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":true,"die":{"sides":8,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"6wd7sis6cxuek5qe","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"skill","name":"Fighting","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":8,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"0il51ao2de0ssdam","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"skill","name":"Intimidation","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":10,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"86k7r8lra8u7th6z","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"skill","name":"Notice","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":true,"die":{"sides":6,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"unpo3hz0wtmoq9br","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"skill","name":"Stealth","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":true,"die":{"sides":8,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"92upt8rqff89z2tl","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"ability","name":"Frenzy","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"An albino ape can make two Fighting attacks each round at –2 penalty.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"exjmtvo71b40etsw","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"ability","name":"Leaper","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"White Apes can jump twice as far as normal.

Often worshipped as gods by primitive cultures and seekers of wisdom driven insane by their delving into the forbidden, they sometimes gift their supplicants with knowledge of an alien science so bizarre and arcane that it may have formed the mythological basis for what we today call magic.<br/> Obscure legends from before the age when man walked upright hint that these elder horrors slithered down from the stars before the dinosaurs arose. They built mighty cities so alien that they warped space and time around them, fought terrible wars and made unholy alliances. How they lost their grip on the world is unknown. Some legends hint that God and His angels cast them out, while others claim that there is no God and that they were banished by things kinder but no less alien. Others yet claim that they were overcome by the powers of proto-human magician priests, or that they were the victims of a cosmological shift – an event soon to reverse itself and allow them purchase in the world of man once more.<br/> Many greater abominations lie trapped outside normal space, hungering in the awful outer darkness between universes, while other lesser creatures slumber in alien tombs and monstrous cities lost beneath the earth or at the bottom of the sea. Others still lurk beyond gateways to distant worlds or hibernate in the depths of deep space, waiting for the call to awaken and feed on minds and souls once more.<br/> Physically, Eldritch Abominations come in a variety of forms, from almost human to physically impossible, from living gases and spatial distortions to writhing masses of tentacles, eyes, tooth-filled maws and wings. Many simply cannot be seen at all, while others are so utterly alien that simply to see and comprehend them means madness or death for the viewer.<br/> As terrible and horrific as these beings are, the greatest threat comes not from them, but from the madmen and fanatics that worship them as gods. There is little evidence to suggest these monstrosities even notice their supplicants, but this does not stop demented cults and sects forming around their legend and working towards hastening the moment of their release into a shocked and screaming world. Such cults are usually debased and utterly beyond reason, practicing perverted and depraved rites and ceremonies, stopping at nothing to secure the freedom of their terrible gods. These cults are often gifted with arcane powers and vile mutations, gifted either deliberately by the Eldritch Abominations or merely as a side-effect of getting   too close to something so unfathomably alien that the universe itself protests at their presence.<br/> Note: For the best examples of Eldritch Abominations from the Pulps, we recommend reading the works of H.P. Lovecraft and his associates, which provided much of the inspiration for this section. We recommend that they not form the basis of the campaign though – if you want to do that there are other games far better suited and with a wealth of published supporting material. Instead they should be used sparingly, as ultimate threats, lurking in the thoughts of your players as their characters explore subterranean temples or investigate dark cults, limited to casting twisted shadows on the walls of reality lest they overwhelm your campaign.<br/> We present no stats for the greater Eldritch Abominations. They are creatures from the outer darkness, defined by their disdain for the rules of our reality. Put simply, they are gods – living plot devices – and they ignore the rules that affect lesser creatures. Meeting one face to gibbering maw is something no sane character should ever want to happen. The stats below can be applied to the lesser Abominations; the creatures that slumber beneath the earth and sea, occasionally roused by intrusion into their forbidden temples and lost cities.<br/> "},"species":{"name":""},"archetype":"","currency":500,"wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":3,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Novice","details":""},"bennies":{"value":0,"max":0},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":false},"token":{"disposition":-1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"displayName":0,"width":16,"height":16,"scale":1,"name":"Eldritch Abomination","actorLink":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","actorId":null},"items":[{"type":"skill","name":"Fighting","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":10,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"48n3s8bykfk7kjdp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"edge","name":"Unkillable","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/edge.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"isArcaneBackground":false,"requirements":{"value":""}},"_id":"bak4z507rga1mnu1","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"armor","name":"Armor +5","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/armor.svg","data":{"description":"The obscene flesh of Eldritch Abomina- tions is thick and rubbery.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"equippable":true,"equipped":true,"isArcaneDevice":false,"arcaneSkillDie":{"sides":4,"modifier":0},"powerPoints":{},"actions":{"skill":"","skillMod":"","dmgMod":"","additional":{}},"minStr":"","armor":5,"toughness":0,"isNaturalArmor":false,"locations":{"head":false,"torso":true,"arms":false,"legs":false}},"_id":"0kmgtkv657bl8w61","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"weapon","name":"Bite","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/weapon.svg","data":{"description":"The gaping, grinding maw of an Eldritch Abomination does Str+d8 damage.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"equippable":true,"equipped":true,"isArcaneDevice":false,"arcaneSkillDie":{"sides":4,"modifier":0},"powerPoints":{},"isVehicular":false,"mods":1,"actions":{"skill":"Fighting","skillMod":"","dmgMod":"","additional":{}},"damage":"@str+d8","range":"","rof":1,"ap":0,"parry":0,"minStr":"","shots":0,"currentShots":0,"ammo":"","autoReload":false},"_id":"aialup61txe10iza","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"ability","name":"Environmental Resistance","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"As a dweller between the stars, Eldritch Abominations take no damage from heat, cold or vacuum.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"2cf3gyaz5b5xo3cy","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"ability","name":"Fast Regeneration","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Eldritch Abominations make a Vigor roll each round to heal wounds. +2 to recover from Shaken.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"kfhtdon6yesjysck","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"ability","name":"Fear (-8)","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Characters who see an Eldritch Abomi- nation must make a Fear check at -8.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"tufpug66oqrtldm9","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"ability","name":"Fearless","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Immune to Fear and Intimidation.

Essentially octopoid in structure, an adult Martian is roughly the size of a bear, with sixteen tentacles arranged in two bunches of eight radiating from the underside of the body. Martians have large dark eyes and a slavering, V-shaped mouth. Apparently lacking vocal cords and any form of normal speech, Martians communicate solely through telepathy. They move sluggishly, with labored breathing, due to the relatively high gravity and atmospheric humidity of Earth.<br/> The Martians appear to be an engineered species, with an extremely simple and stripped-down physiology supporting a vast brain. They lack a conventional digestive system and feed on the blood of living creatures, absorbing it directly into their circulatory system through a hollow bone tube – like the horn of a narwhal – which they can extend from the mouth with enough force to pierce a human skull. It has been theorized that the invasion of 1901 was motivated not by a desire for territory, but to capture and cultivate mankind as a food supply.<br/> As they are effectively giant brains, the Martians have become adept at creating armored vehicles that act as prosthetic bodies, such as their tripod fighting machines or the smaller handling machines seen in their landing sites and fortified areas.<br/> While it is popularly known that the Martians are fatally affected by Earthly germs and bacteria, this is not strictly true. While their lungs are somewhat vulnerable to respiratory fungal infections and diseases such as the form of weaponized flu virus that was used to eliminate the 1901 expeditionary force (a biological weapon that is suspected of having later mutated into the deadly Spanish Flu that killed nearly 5% of the world’s population between 1918 and 1920), they are in fact so alien that very few terrestrial viruses or bacteria can affect them. Those that do, however, are invariably lethal to them.<br/> Little is known of Martian culture, due mainly to   their unrelenting hostility and the difficulty inherent in taking them alive. However, analysis of their cadavers and the remains of their technology has led to many scientists theorizing that they are not in fact native to Mars but may have been using that planet as a staging post for their invasion attempt. Further, it is now thought that once they lost contact with the Earth expeditionary force, they turned their gaze to Venus, which many suspect they have successfully conquered.<br/>

These stats can also be used for giant squid.<br/> "},"species":{"name":""},"archetype":"","currency":500,"wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Novice","details":""},"bennies":{"value":0,"max":0},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":false},"token":{"disposition":-1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"displayName":0,"width":4,"height":4,"scale":1,"name":"Octopus, Giant","actorLink":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","actorId":null},"items":[{"type":"skill","name":"Athletics","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":true,"die":{"sides":6,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"hl3dcvt1yu9r884f","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"skill","name":"Fighting","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":8,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"gzayiinaoh53d7wi","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"skill","name":"Notice","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":true,"die":{"sides":6,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"otooasymsfeprlki","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"skill","name":"Stealth","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":true,"die":{"sides":6,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"knqdngxh0ei7okn3","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"skill","name":"Swimming","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":6,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"2zm7n841sbwxofmt","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"ability","name":"Aquatic","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Giant octopuses can breathe underwater and swim at Pace 6”.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"cjjzz8pflhu0f29y","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"ability","name":"Camouflage","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Giant octopuses can hide in plain sight by changing their color and the texture of their skin to match the seabed. -4 on all Notice attempts when trying to spot a giant octopus.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"iogoj6xarqsyqh2j","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"ability","name":"Huge","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Characters add +4 when attacking a giant octopus due to their great size.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"civfor7nh4n4jcup","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"ability","name":"Ink Cloud","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"A giant octopus can expel a cloud of black ink once per day.

Death Worms reproduce by laying eggs in the decaying remains of their prey, buried in underground nests.<br/> "},"species":{"name":""},"archetype":"","currency":500,"wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":0,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Novice","details":""},"bennies":{"value":0,"max":0},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":false},"token":{"disposition":-1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"displayName":0,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"name":"Mongolian Death Worm","actorLink":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","actorId":null},"items":[{"type":"skill","name":"Athletics","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":true,"die":{"sides":8,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"24wpax675o4h5hrh","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"skill","name":"Fighting","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":6,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"qjmlzgkysk81bgty","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"skill","name":"Notice","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":true,"die":{"sides":6,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"7jw9rychy774yp6n","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"skill","name":"Shooting","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":8,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"uzb1177gwclx5z0w","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"skill","name":"Stealth","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":true,"die":{"sides":10,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"apz4ef4dmm5mz899","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"weapon","name":"Bite","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/weapon.svg","data":{"description":"Str+d6","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"equippable":true,"equipped":true,"isArcaneDevice":false,"arcaneSkillDie":{"sides":4,"modifier":0},"powerPoints":{},"isVehicular":false,"mods":1,"actions":{"skill":"Fighting","skillMod":"","dmgMod":"","additional":{}},"damage":"@str+d6","range":"","rof":1,"ap":0,"parry":0,"minStr":"","shots":0,"currentShots":0,"ammo":"","autoReload":false},"_id":"llc3joz3oic8i6l1","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"ability","name":"Burrow (6)","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Burrow (6)","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"ddhox8sy9c8x5yp7","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"ability","name":"Fearless","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Immune to fear and Intimidation.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"gi1fjhmzf19zl1fa","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"ability","name":"Poison (6)","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Poison (6)","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"f7sw0fsg24ntxr5l","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"ability","name":"Size +1","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Increases Toughness by +1.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"hsqexlyj62jhpdb8","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"ability","name":"Spray","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"The Death Worm can spray its poison using its Shooting skill.

Some War Machines carry an extra Heat Ray instead of a Black Smoke Launcher, or a metal holding cage for captured humans.<br/> "},"species":{"name":""},"archetype":"","currency":500,"wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":3,"ignored":1},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Novice","details":""},"bennies":{"value":0,"max":0},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":false},"token":{"disposition":-1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"displayName":0,"width":16,"height":16,"scale":1,"name":"Martian War Machine","actorLink":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","actorId":null},"items":[{"type":"skill","name":"Fighting","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":8,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"6l89rvrifxbeul08","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"skill","name":"Notice","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":true,"die":{"sides":10,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"n4w4u9l80c3c2pos","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"skill","name":"Shooting","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":10,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"iukax1i1kydjpehc","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"skill","name":"Intim- Idation","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":12,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"6hl1zskmbob1ojv5","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"armor","name":"Armor +6","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/armor.svg","data":{"description":"Armor +6","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"equippable":true,"equipped":true,"isArcaneDevice":false,"arcaneSkillDie":{"sides":4,"modifier":0},"powerPoints":{},"actions":{"skill":"","skillMod":"","dmgMod":"","additional":{}},"minStr":"","armor":6,"toughness":0,"isNaturalArmor":false,"locations":{"head":false,"torso":true,"arms":false,"legs":false}},"_id":"a3zfx8hehwr54p3g","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"ability","name":"Bellow","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"War Machines can emit a terrifying bat- tle-cry of “UUUUULLAAAA”.

Essentially octopoid in structure, an adult Martian is roughly the size of a bear, with sixteen tentacles arranged in two bunches of eight radiating from the underside of the body. Martians have large dark eyes and a slavering, V-shaped mouth. Apparently lacking vocal cords and any form of normal speech, Martians communicate solely through telepathy. They move sluggishly, with labored breathing, due to the relatively high gravity and atmospheric humidity of Earth.<br/> The Martians appear to be an engineered species, with an extremely simple and stripped-down physiology supporting a vast brain. They lack a conventional digestive system and feed on the blood of living creatures, absorbing it directly into their circulatory system through a hollow bone tube – like the horn of a narwhal – which they can extend from the mouth with enough force to pierce a human skull. It has been theorized that the invasion of 1901 was motivated not by a desire for territory, but to capture and cultivate mankind as a food supply.<br/> As they are effectively giant brains, the Martians have become adept at creating armored vehicles that act as prosthetic bodies, such as their tripod fighting machines or the smaller handling machines seen in their landing sites and fortified areas.<br/> While it is popularly known that the Martians are fatally affected by Earthly germs and bacteria, this is not strictly true. While their lungs are somewhat vulnerable to respiratory fungal infections and diseases such as the form of weaponized flu virus that was used to eliminate the 1901 expeditionary force (a biological weapon that is suspected of having later mutated into the deadly Spanish Flu that killed nearly 5% of the world’s population between 1918 and 1920), they are in fact so alien that very few terrestrial viruses or bacteria can affect them. Those that do, however, are invariably lethal to them.<br/> Little is known of Martian culture, due mainly to   their unrelenting hostility and the difficulty inherent in taking them alive. However, analysis of their cadavers and the remains of their technology has led to many scientists theorizing that they are not in fact native to Mars but may have been using that planet as a staging post for their invasion attempt. Further, it is now thought that once they lost contact with the Earth expeditionary force, they turned their gaze to Venus, which many suspect they have successfully conquered.<br/>

The origin of the Stinging Bell Plant is unknown, but the wide distribution has led some authorities to propose the theory that the plants may have come to Earth on cometary debris. While many botanists refute this theory, and still more deny the Bell Plant even exists, it is true that the Stinging Bell Plant resembles no other plant on Earth. Others believe it to be the product of selective breeding, the deliberate creation of a diseased mind.<br/> The Stinging Bell Plant resembles the funnel of a greatly enlarged pitcher plant, emerging from a dense round bole of thickly gnarled roots. The funnel contains a stamen-like stinger on a long- fibrous filament that, when fully extended, can measure nearly 13 ft in length. The Stinging Bell Plant can launch the sting at high speed and considerable accuracy. Contact with bare skin can cause an agonizing chemical burn, while repeated stings can be lethal.<br/> Bell Plants are ambush predators, striking from a distance (using their Shooting skill) to incapacitate and kill their prey. Once a target has been stung to death the Stinging Bell Plant uses its unique tri- pedal root structure to drag itself over to the corpse, where it digs feeder roots into the body and excretes digestive enzymes.<br/> Stinging Bell Plants reproduce by releasing drifting white seeds, like dandelions, into the air.<br/> "},"species":{"name":""},"archetype":"","currency":500,"wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":0,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Novice","details":""},"bennies":{"value":0,"max":0},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":false},"token":{"disposition":-1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"displayName":0,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"name":"Stinging Bell Plant","actorLink":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","actorId":null},"items":[{"type":"skill","name":"Shooting","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":8,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"955s2teecvicarxw","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"edge","name":"Trademark Weapon (Sting)","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/edge.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"isArcaneBackground":false,"requirements":{"value":""}},"_id":"5f3ryx42oo7p33pw","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"weapon","name":"Sting","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/weapon.svg","data":{"description":"Str +d4, Poison, Reach 4.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"equippable":true,"equipped":true,"isArcaneDevice":false,"arcaneSkillDie":{"sides":4,"modifier":0},"powerPoints":{},"isVehicular":false,"mods":1,"actions":{"skill":"Fighting","skillMod":"","dmgMod":"","additional":{}},"damage":"@str +d4","range":"","rof":1,"ap":0,"parry":0,"minStr":"","shots":0,"currentShots":0,"ammo":"","autoReload":false},"_id":"1fnmty4gilrnop68","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"ability","name":"Fearless","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Immune to fear and Intimidation.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"b3ky9jsq80arh06h","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"ability","name":"Mindless","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Immune to mind-affecting effects.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"8y6g2schxif2s5nz","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"ability","name":"Plant","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"+2 to recover from Shaken, ignore wound modifiers, poison, and extra damage from called shots.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"pyoerf619gfdp1ju","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"weapon","name":"Poison (6)","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/weapon.svg","data":{"description":"The victim must make a successful Vigor check at -6 or be Stunned, take a Wound (two with a Critical Failure), and perish in 2d6 rounds unless successfully treated.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"equippable":true,"equipped":true,"isArcaneDevice":false,"arcaneSkillDie":{"sides":4,"modifier":0},"powerPoints":{},"isVehicular":false,"mods":1,"actions":{"skill":"Fighting","skillMod":"","dmgMod":"","additional":{}},"damage":"2d6","range":"","rof":1,"ap":0,"parry":0,"minStr":"","shots":0,"currentShots":0,"ammo":"","autoReload":false},"_id":"uwmiracj9ui7d4k1","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}}],"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"UeH4lLk57wAOn2HV":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Actor.wsiui6PSc7Y8DteI"}},"_id":"vnO9vf4AIoqB4YrV"}

The origin of the Stinging Bell Plant is unknown, but the wide distribution has led some authorities to propose the theory that the plants may have come to Earth on cometary debris. While many botanists refute this theory, and still more deny the Bell Plant even exists, it is true that the Stinging Bell Plant resembles no other plant on Earth. Others believe it to be the product of selective breeding, the deliberate creation of a diseased mind.<br/> The Stinging Bell Plant resembles the funnel of a greatly enlarged pitcher plant, emerging from a dense round bole of thickly gnarled roots. The funnel contains a stamen-like stinger on a long- fibrous filament that, when fully extended, can measure nearly 13 ft in length. The Stinging Bell Plant can launch the sting at high speed and considerable accuracy. Contact with bare skin can cause an agonizing chemical burn, while repeated stings can be lethal.<br/> Bell Plants are ambush predators, striking from a distance (using their Shooting skill) to incapacitate and kill their prey. Once a target has been stung to death the Stinging Bell Plant uses its unique tri- pedal root structure to drag itself over to the corpse, where it digs feeder roots into the body and excretes digestive enzymes.<br/> Stinging Bell Plants reproduce by releasing drifting white seeds, like dandelions, into the air.<br/> "},"species":{"name":""},"archetype":"","currency":500,"wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":0,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Novice","details":""},"bennies":{"value":0,"max":0},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":false},"token":{"disposition":-1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"displayName":0,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"name":"Stinging Bell Plant","actorLink":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","actorId":null},"items":[{"type":"skill","name":"Shooting","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":8,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"955s2teecvicarxw","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"edge","name":"Trademark Weapon (Sting)","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/edge.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"isArcaneBackground":false,"requirements":{"value":""}},"_id":"5f3ryx42oo7p33pw","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"weapon","name":"Sting","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/weapon.svg","data":{"description":"Str +d4, Poison, Reach 4.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"equippable":true,"equipped":true,"isArcaneDevice":false,"arcaneSkillDie":{"sides":4,"modifier":0},"powerPoints":{},"isVehicular":false,"mods":1,"actions":{"skill":"Fighting","skillMod":"","dmgMod":"","additional":{}},"damage":"@str +d4","range":"","rof":1,"ap":0,"parry":0,"minStr":"","shots":0,"currentShots":0,"ammo":"","autoReload":false},"_id":"1fnmty4gilrnop68","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"ability","name":"Fearless","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Immune to fear and Intimidation.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"b3ky9jsq80arh06h","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"ability","name":"Mindless","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Immune to mind-affecting effects.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"8y6g2schxif2s5nz","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"ability","name":"Plant","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"+2 to recover from Shaken, ignore wound modifiers, poison, and extra damage from called shots.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"pyoerf619gfdp1ju","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"type":"weapon","name":"Poison (6)","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/weapon.svg","data":{"description":"The victim must make a successful Vigor check at -6 or be Stunned, take a Wound (two with a Critical Failure), and perish in 2d6 rounds unless successfully treated.","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"equippable":true,"equipped":true,"isArcaneDevice":false,"arcaneSkillDie":{"sides":4,"modifier":0},"powerPoints":{},"isVehicular":false,"mods":1,"actions":{"skill":"Fighting","skillMod":"","dmgMod":"","additional":{}},"damage":"2d6","range":"","rof":1,"ap":0,"parry":0,"minStr":"","shots":0,"currentShots":0,"ammo":"","autoReload":false},"_id":"uwmiracj9ui7d4k1","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}}],"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"UeH4lLk57wAOn2HV":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Actor.wsiui6PSc7Y8DteI"},"cf":{"id":"temp_p5o3zxlv0a9","color":"#000000"}}}

Monstrous spiders also seem to possess a form of hyper-efficient oxygen carrier in their blood instead of hemoglobin, increasing the effectiveness of their respiration.<br/> Due to their immense size and weight, monstrous spiders are poor climbers and do not spin webs as traps.

This is entirely up to the Game Master, the setting, and the description of the creature.</p><p>Communication: Note that demons are not (generally) telepathic. If the summoner plans on sending the demon out of sight, he’d best give it very specific instructions. Intelligent demons may be given physical equipment (such as cell phones or transmitters in modern settings), but whether or not they actually use these tools is entirely up to them.</p><p>More on Trappings: Most demon summoning spells require trappings such as candles or braziers, chanting, and at least a small amount of blood. Most have unique requirements tied to the type of creature being summoned as well. For instance, the dark god Crazalphasalius (the fire god) can only be summoned if there is a conflagration at least the size of a burning house. Summoning a demon of gluttony might require a massive feast be set out and consumed.</p><p>Requirements might also include celestial events, such as phases of the moon or planetary alignments, although the latter should be reserved for truly powerful creatures and acts as a natural limitation on how often these monstrosities can be summoned.","notes":"undefined","additionalStats":{},"equippable":false,"equipped":false,"actions":{"skill":"","skillMod":"","dmgMod":"","additional":{}},"rank":"Veteran","pp":"Special","damage":"","range":"Smarts x2","duration":"Sm x hours","trapping":"","arcane":"","skill":"","modifiers":[]},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"UeH4lLk57wAOn2HV":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.jd-powers-import.eQRKkY2tAeA8yzvb"},"cf":{"id":"temp_ak7mg9m6l1","color":"#000000"}}}

They spend most of their time in the latter, drifting in a state of semi-consciousness and glimpsing visions of the real world. “Good” spirits find this peaceful and only interact with the mortal realm if forcibly called to it. Restless entities have a very different take. These visions—or memories of their terrible lives—drive them to terrible violence. They actively attempt to reenter the physical domain and take their vengeance on the living beings they find there.</p><p>Summoning a spirit requires a ritual of some sort—typically a seance and/or important artifact of the person in life (if it had one prior to its ethereal existence).</p><p>The summoner then spends the Power Points and makes an opposed arcane skill roll versus the entity’s Spirit.</p><p>•Failure: The entity breaks through with great violence! Everyone directly involved with the casting must make a Spirit roll at –4 or be Fatigued for the next 24 hours. The spirit then wreaks whatever havoc it can based on its particular powers and abilities. Most ghosts and the like can manifest for a few minutes before returning to the netherworld.</p><p>•Success: The entity is summoned long enough to answer one question. It is subdued and cannot attack or use its powers and abilities during this time. After the question is answered, the thing issues a horrible screech or ectoplasmic detonation that leaves everyone directly involved Fatigued for the next 24 hours.</p><p>•Raise: The spirit will answer three questions before fading back into the netherworld.</p><p>Tasks: As an alternative to asking a spirit for information, the entity can be tasked instead. The duration is one night with a success and three with a raise. Use the summon demon success, failure, and raise results to determine how the thing behaves.</p><p>What do Spirits Know: This depends largely on the entity itself. Spirits essentially have “tunnel vision” to the rest of the world, so their knowledge is generally confined to their local area and things relating to their particular nature.</p><p>The ghost of a murdered lover likely focuses entirely on the event of her death, how she gave her heart to her beloved, and how the diamond he gave her sparkled. The same spirit might then quickly turn violent, focusing entirely on how her lover’s hands then tightened on her throat after she found him in bed with some hated rival—and choking the life of those involved in summoning her.</p><p>A nature spirit has an entirely different perspective.

The cost of the swarm trap is the same as the normal casting cost. A swarm trap is where part of a swarm lie in wait for something to come within its radius of affect.

Spells that have a range can typically be used as a swarm trap.</p>\n<p>The caster stands at the center of the desired area of effect and casts the spell as normal. However, it does not go off immediately as the swarm simply stands in place waiting to be triggered. The swarm trap lasts as long as the caster stays within the range of the spell (for example, 2 x smarts for Blast) or dismissed. The caster may decide when the swarm triggers by setting a condition( for example, \"Someone enters the room\", \"Three bandits are by the tree\"). However, if the mage wishes to trigger the trap before the condition is met, the triggering uses the same rules as someone on Hold performing an Interrupting Action (Nano&shy;Mages also need to have Athletics to be successful).

The caster decides it is best to be careful and uses the Selective (+1 point for a total of 3 points) modifier to only affect the Bandits. The mage decides to trigger the trap when three bandits enter the blast radius of the Power. After casting, the Mage moves away 6 paces. Two Bandits stop to fire their pistols and another runs into the radius of the Blast Power. Since none of the bandits triggered the spell last round, the Mage decides to move another 4 paces and maintains the trap. Since he is within his Smarts X 2 (d10 Smarts) range of the Blast Power, the trap remains in effect. This round another bandit advanced into the blass area. The Mage decides to trigger the trap immediately instead of waiting for the condition to be met. The Mage rolls a 10 for Athletics check. The Bandits roll only a 5 and the swarm's Blast effect is triggered before the bandits can react. The Bandits take 2d6 damage! Now they know there is a Mage to contend with! </em></p>\n<p>A swarm trap cannot be noticed or detected under normal circumstances (the GM may decide if Detect Arcana will discover traps).

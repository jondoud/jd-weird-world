Former Chicago mobster, gun hand</em></p>\n<p><strong>Languages: </strong>English (Native), German, Italian, Spanish</p>\n<p><strong>Description: </strong>Standing at 5&rsquo;11&rdquo; and of slim build, Franco cuts a handsome figure in his well-tailored suits. He wears his hair short and a thin mustache is his only facial hair. Franco is always well groomed and rarely goes anywhere without a suit, his trench coat and at least one of his trusty .45s</p>\n<p><strong>Background:</strong> Franco is of Italian heritage, born in 1909 in Chicago to Italian immigrants Alessandro and Giulia Giovanni. Sandro, as he liked to be known, was an importer of Italian wines and spirits until 1920 when the prohibition laws effectively closed his business. Sandro used his connections back in Italy to carry on an import business but his goods were labeled as &ldquo;Communion Wine&rdquo; which was not restricted under prohibition. He sold his wine through the Chicago mob, initially under Al Capone and then under a succession of bosses.</p>\n<p>Franco, a child when prohibition began, followed his father into organized crime when he came of age in 1930. He was a bodyguard and enforcer and quickly gained a reputation as a man who could be trusted. When prohibition ended in 1933, Franco&rsquo;s father moved quickly to legitimize his business once again, a move which angered his former bosses. Sandro was ordered to pay protection money to the mob, which he refused to do, feeling his years being tied to them was payment enough. In late 1935, the then mob boss grew tired of Sandro and ordered him killed. The execution was carried out by Johnny Barleish, an enforcer of Irish origin who was promptly killed by Franco in retribution.</p>\n<p>After killing Barleish, Franco knew Chicago was no longer a safe place. He quickly arranged for himself, his wife, his mother and his sister Maria to move to England where they would start a new life. Franco also pledged he would never again serve the criminal underworld. Unfortunately, the criminal underworld would return to haunt Franco. His wife was killed in a botched hit on Franco when she was caught in the crossfire. Two of the three assassins were shot by Franco, the last got away. The two Franco had taken out were Irish.</p>\n<p>Seeking ways to legitimately hunt his wife&rsquo;s killer, Franco offered his services to Scotland Yard as an independent adviser on organized crime. He worked alongside Eric Mather, a rising star of the Criminal Investigation Department and quickly helped them to make significant arrests. As yet, Franco has not identified the gunman he seeks.</p>\n<p>As his reputation as an undercover operative grew, he attracted the attention of government organizations including the Secret Intelligence Service. Since 1937 he has carried out a number of deniable missions for the SIS as a freelancer, primarily operating in Italy and the Italian colonies in Africa. Franco&rsquo;s primary contact with the SIS is Beverly Erridge and it is she who invited Franco to join Section D.</p>"},"species":{"name":""},"archetype":"","currency":"500","wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":3,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":4,"rank":"Seasoned","details":""},"bennies":{"value":3,"max":3},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":true},"token":{"disposition":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"displayName":0,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"name":"Franco Giovanni","actorLink":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"modules/jd-weird-world/images/archetypes/section-d-taster/Franco%20Giovanni.webp","actorId":null},"items":[{"type":"skill","name":"Athletics","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skills/jump-across.svg","data":{"description":"<div class=\"swade-core\">\n<p>Athletics combines an individual&rsquo;s coordin&shy;ation with learned skills such as climbing, jumping, balancing, biking, wrestling, skiing, swimming, throwing, or catching.

Hand-to-Hand combat expert</em></p>\n<p><strong>Languages:</strong> Cantonese (Native), English, Mandarin&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Description: </strong>What Minh Li lacks in physical stature, she more than makes up for in power. Standing at 5&rsquo;2&rdquo;, she is diminutive but is all honed muscle and moves with a gymnastic grace that betrays her physical ability. Growing up in the bosom of the British diplomatic corps taught Minh to act with decorum and always be immaculately presented, but she has the ability to explode into action at any time.</p>\n<p><strong>Background: </strong>Minh&rsquo;s father Yuxuan has been in the service of the British Government in Hong Kong since being appointed as a translator at the age of eighteen by Sir Henry Arthur Blake in 1901. Though still two years from manhood according to Chinese culture, he excelled in his role and was quickly promoted. When he came of age, his position gave him his adult name. Yuxuan means &lsquo;High House&rsquo;, a reference to the Governor&rsquo;s residence in Hong Kong. In later years, his role as adviser on dealings with the Chinese population on political, cultural and business matters was instrumental in the colony&rsquo;s business success and growth.</p>\n<p>War was raging across the world when Minh was born in late 1915 and with China itself in turmoil, the Li family tied itself ever closer to the British. When Minh&rsquo;s Mother died of Tuberculosis in 1917, Minh was unofficially adopted by the ladies of the Governor&rsquo;s household. She grew up in a happy environment, learning the English language, attending an unofficial finishing school with the household staff and learning the old ways from her father. Yuxuan also made sure Minh could take of herself. From an early age she practiced gymnastics and was a student of the martial arts from the age of seven.</p>\n<p>Being a student of the martial arts from a young age gave Minh the skills needed to join the Governor&rsquo;s close protection team as a bodyguard when she was eighteen. Nobody suspected the young girl, looking like a lowly aide, of being able to protect the Governor of Hong Kong. On many occasions, Minh ensured the Governor stayed free from harm when danger was abroad. While nowhere near a master martial artist, Minh is a force to be reckoned with.</p>\n<p>In early 1936, Minh was taken under the wing of Sir Andrew Caldecott, then the Governor of Hong Kong, after her father was injured saving his life. Sir Andrew and Yuxuan had been traveling to a meeting with bankers when their car was ambushed. Without thought for personal protection, Yuxuan threw himself across the Governor and took four bullets for his loyalty. Although never proven, it was believed to be an assassination attempt by the Japanese.</p>\n<p>When Caldecott&rsquo;s tenure as Governor ended in October of 1937, Minh and her father were offered the opportunity to come to England as members of his staff. Her father, despite his injuries, maintains a position as a personal secretary and adviser to Sir Andrew. Minh remained in the role of bodyguard until her capabilities became known to an old friend of Sir Andrew, Claude Dansey. He was working with Admiral Hugh Sinclair, Chief of the SIS, on a new unit tasked with carrying out clandestine operations against potential enemies of the Empire. In early 1938, Minh was introduced to Sir Laurence Grand, head Section D.</p>\n<p>Yuxuan taught Minh to be both a good daughter of the Empire, and to honor the skills and traditions of her ancestors. Both hate what is happening in China at the hands of the Japanese, feel the British Empire could do more, and Minh should be a part of that.</p>"},"species":{"name":""},"archetype":"","currency":"500","wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":3,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":4,"rank":"Seasoned","details":""},"bennies":{"value":3,"max":3},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":true},"token":{"disposition":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"displayName":0,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"name":"Minh Li","actorLink":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"modules/jd-weird-world/images/archetypes/section-d-taster/Minh%20Li.webp","actorId":null},"items":[{"type":"skill","name":"Athletics","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skills/jump-across.svg","data":{"description":"<div class=\"swade-core\">\n<p>Athletics combines an individual&rsquo;s coordin&shy;ation with learned skills such as climbing, jumping, balancing, biking, wrestling, skiing, swimming, throwing, or catching.

Tailor, actor and exiled German Jew</em></p>\n<p><strong>Languages: </strong>German (Native), Arabic, English, French, Hebrew, Italian, Spanish, Swedish, Russian</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> A little under six feet in height and of slim, athletic build. Rudolph is an attractive man with a dazzling smile, mousy brown hair and blue eyes. He dresses with impeccable style and carries himself with a confidence born of knowing he can talk his way out of almost any situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Background: </strong>Born in 1906 to Shimon and Rachael Miesel, Rudolph and his older sister Sarah enjoyed a privileged lifestyle in a suburb of Bremen. Shimon was a tailor of some repute and despite hard economic times, was able to afford the nice things in life and a good education for his children.</p>\n<p>After graduating with a Business degree from the Goethe University, Rudolph joined his father&rsquo;s business. He is not a practical man, but he excelled at business and particularly buying and selling. Rudolph helped grow the business by securing strong trade deals with cloth manufacturers and improving sales. By 1931, Miesel and Son tailors were established in Berlin and Dusseldorf as well as Bremen. At this time, Rudolph also gained an interest in the performing arts after Miesel and Son were asked to provide costumes for a local play. He proved to be a natural actor, no doubt assisted by his good looks and confident demeanor.</p>\n<p>Rudolph met Gertrude Hartmann when they performed together in a production of The Three Musketeers. Love blossomed and the two planned to marry but in early 1933 things changed. Adolph Hitler gained power and immediately implemented anti-Jewish policies. Gertrude&rsquo;s father, believing the Nazi propaganda, now disapproved of Gertrude&rsquo;s relationship with Rudolph. Although still in love with Gertrude, he hasn't seen her for many years.</p>\n<p>In September of 1935, Hitler announced new laws stripping German Jews of citizenship. The writing was on the wall and the family decided to leave Germany. Rudolph&rsquo;s sister was already married and had emigrated to America with her new family, they were safe. Shimon sent Rudolph to London where he had arranged a job for him with an old friend. Rudolph was to establish a home while Shimon closed the business and then he and Rachael would follow. Rudolph left Germany in early November of 1935 and hasn&rsquo;t seen or heard from his parents since.</p>\n<p>Rudolph worked with Moss Brothers of Covent Garden as a salesman but in late 1936 he applied to join the British Army. He felt he might be able to do something to help his parents as a soldier but because of his German heritage he was rejected. In early 1937 he received a visit from a young lady named Beverly Erridge. She worked for the British government and had a copy of the army application in her briefcase. She even knew Rudolph was a promising actor and had business connections in Germany. Rudolph was offered the opportunity to go to Germany in disguise and take photographs of the burgeoning Nazi war machine. She also offered to give Rudolph some time to try and seek his parents. Rudolph accepted and carried out the assignment successfully but was not able to locate his parents. Their home in Bremen had been vandalized and their business premises looted.</p>\n<p>Rudolph has since received training in the use of firearms and unarmed combat and has perfected the art of disguise. He carried out several assignments as a freelancer for Miss Erridge and in January of 1938 was invited to join the newly formed Section D of the Secret Intelligence Service. He adopted the English name Randall Macey and began active service in April of 1938 vowing to seek revenge on the regime that ruined and imprisoned his family and stole his love from him.</p>"},"species":{"name":""},"archetype":"","currency":"500","wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":3,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Novice","details":""},"bennies":{"value":3,"max":3},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":true},"token":{"disposition":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"displayName":0,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"name":"Rudolph Miesel","actorLink":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"modules/jd-weird-world/images/archetypes/section-d-taster/Rudoloph%20Miesel.webp","actorId":null},"items":[{"type":"skill","name":"Academics","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skills/graduate-cap.svg","data":{"description":"<div class=\"swade-core\"><p>Academics reflects knowledge of the liberal arts, social sciences, literature, history, archaeology, and similar fields.

What normally separates occult heroes from the villains is the type of magic used; most heroes use purely defensive magic, in the form of exorcisms, protective circles, charms or counter-spells. Offensive spells tend to be seen as inherently evil. Many rely on a single powerful item - such as Thomas Carnacki’s famous “Electric Pentacle”, John Thunstone’s silver sword, or John the Balladeer’s silver-stringed guitar – in conjunction with one or two spells. Very few are powerhouses of magic in the tradition of Dr Stephen Strange or Gandalf the Grey, or are interested in pushing the boundaries of magical knowledge. In a very real sense, it could be said that what distinguishes the villains from the heroes is ambition. To the occult villain, magic is the key to power, and power is the gateway to the fulfilment of their desires; desires that must be satisfied, at any cost...<br/> Quote: “By the Eye of Odin, what is that?” "},"species":{"name":""},"archetype":"","currency":"500","wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{"value":15,"max":15},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":3,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Novice","details":""},"bennies":{"value":3,"max":3},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":true},"token":{"disposition":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"displayName":0,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"name":"Arcanist (Novice)","actorLink":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"modules/jd-weird-world/images/archetypes/pulp-fantastic/arcanist.webp","actorId":null},"items":[{"type":"skill","name":"Athletics","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skills/jump-across.svg","data":{"description":"<div class=\"swade-core\">\n<p>Athletics combines an individual&rsquo;s coordin&shy;ation with learned skills such as climbing, jumping, balancing, biking, wrestling, skiing, swimming, throwing, or catching.

Archaeologist and master of Breaking and Entering</em></p>\n<p><strong>Languages: </strong>English (Native), Arabic, Flemish, French, German</p>\n<p><strong>Description: </strong>Arthur Schimm is a curious character. Outwardly he is suave, good looking and well dressed. Despite his looks, Arthur is socially awkward unless he is among academics. Here he thrives with historians, archaeologists and scholars of all things ancient.</p>\n<p><strong>Background: </strong>Arthur was born in February of 1910 in Manchester, England to parents of Dutch descent. He enjoyed a privileged middle-class upbringing and excelled academically, always favoring history. In 1928, he was offered a place at Cambridge to read history where he studied ancient civilizations with Egypt being a particular favorite. While at Cambridge he met a young languages student called Beverly Erridge and though there was no romance, Arthur has carried a candle for her ever since and they have remained friends.</p>\n<p>After graduating, Arthur was offered an extraordinary opportunity when he was selected to travel to Egypt to work as an archivist on the findings of the tomb of Tutankhamun. Although Howard Carter was no longer involved, having opened the tomb some ten years earlier, archaeologists were still finding items of interest. One such item came across Arthur&rsquo;s desk.</p>\n<p>The item was unusual for things found in Tutankhamun&rsquo;s tomb in that it was quite plain. A scarab beetle, simply carved from jade, and set with a pendant hanger although no chain was present. Arthur was drawn to the object immediately. He knew there was something special about the pendant and that it did not belong where it was found. He was told it was found on the body of what they thought was a tomb robber, though there were no signs of robbery or indeed entry into the chamber where the amulet was found. Arthur put the pendant in his pocket and hoped the scholars would forget about it, they did. It is said though, certain members of the Egyptian Department of Antiquities are keen to speak with Arthur.</p>\n<p>As he studied the pendant Arthur sensed it could do things, miraculous things. He started to wear the pendant around his neck, under his shirt, always out of site. In time Arthur learned the pendant was connected strongly to the minor sun god Khepri who has the body of a man and the head of a scarab beetle. The ancient Egyptians believed Khepri was the god of the morning sun, Ra midday sun, and Atum the setting sun. This resonated with Khepri&rsquo;s other aspects of rejuvenation and birth. As Arthur learned more about Khepri he found himself offering prayers to the ancient god and that is when the amulet showed him its powers. He learned he could use it to connect himself to earth and rock. At first, he just sank into the soil. Then he learned to control and dictate the movement. Next, he learned to apply the amulet&rsquo;s power to just his hands or feet and he found he could climb sheer surfaces, almost like a beetle.</p>\n<p>Most recently he learned the true power of Khepri&rsquo;s aspect as a god of rebirth and rejuvenation when the amulet healed wounds he had suffered battling tomb robbers in Persia.</p>\n<p>Arthur now earns his living in archaeology and has a reputation for having an uncanny ability to tell laborers exactly where to dig. He is also rumored to carry out some free- lance work for the British government and his former collegiate friend Beverly, but he doesn&rsquo;t talk about that......</p>"},"species":{"name":""},"archetype":"","currency":"500","wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{"value":10,"max":10},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":3,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":4,"rank":"Seasoned","details":""},"bennies":{"value":3,"max":3},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":true},"token":{"disposition":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"displayName":0,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"name":"Arthur Schimm","actorLink":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"modules/jd-weird-world/images/archetypes/section-d-taster/Arthur%20Schimm.webp","actorId":null},"items":[{"type":"skill","name":"Academics","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skills/graduate-cap.svg","data":{"description":"<div class=\"swade-core\"><p>Academics reflects knowledge of the liberal arts, social sciences, literature, history, archaeology, and similar fields.

He is a high-caliber journalist and regards his calling as more of a religion than a job. He sees it as his duty to locate a story and report it to the people, as long as his editors believe it will sell papers. The people have a right to know, and the news hound is the one to tell them.<br/> The news hound goes where the story is, wherever that story makes take them. News hounds sometimes travel with photographers, camera crews and other groups, but those are rare. There are far more undercover journalists, writers, and news hounds traveling around behind the scenes than anyone knows. Not all these actually work for news services. Some are researching articles, books, and other publications.<br/> In the end, though, journalists are all good at one thing and one thing in particular – digging for secrets. To find out what they need to know, they will often do or say anything at all. They do have their own level of integrity, however. In pursuing their knowledge, all good news hounds instinctively obey the following rules: Verify the Facts: Journalists never report information as truth without verifying them first. Something that is unverified is merely ‘alleged.’ If two or more independent sources corroborate a piece of data, that is enough to consider it a fact. A news hound who fails to obey this rule receives a -2 penalty on all future Persuasion checks against people familiar with them.<br/> Protect the Source: Good news hounds never reveal the source of their information. A news hound who gives up his source quickly receives a reputation as untrustworthy and finds it much harder to get anyone to turn over information. A news hound who does not live up to this restriction suffers a -2 penalty to all Knowledge checks from people who recognize them.<br/> Remain Impartial: A good journalist always avoids making judgments about what he learns, even if he is an eyewitness to events. The news hound’s job is to present the news or information strictly as it exists, without any attempt to analyze it. If a news hound resorts to judging the news or telling others what to think, he tends to make others angry and upset. He receives a -2 penalty to all Persuasion checks from anyone who knows the news hound’s identity.<br/> Quote:“I need to phone my editor.

Retired Royal Marines Captain and holder of the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal</em></p>\n<p><strong>Languages: </strong>English (Native), French, German, Swahili</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> Captain William Hopewell is in his late thirties and has had a full life serving in the Royal Marines. Old habits die hard and William is always clean shaven and keeps his brown hair cut short. Being used to the Navy providing all he needs has left William with little sense of style and he wears cheap, functional clothes, usually because it&rsquo;s all he can afford.</p>\n<p><strong>Background: </strong>William Hopewell was born in London into a military family in March 1900. William&rsquo;s father Malcolm had served in the Kent Regiment of foot and his grandfather William with the Household Cavalry. With this background, a career in the military was inevitable and William enlisted in the Royal Marines at the age of 16.</p>\n<p>He excelled as a cadet and went to war in France not long after his 17th birthday having been promoted to Lance Corporal. On the 23rd of April 1918, William was involved in the ill-fated Zeebrugge Raid intended to blockade the port of Zeebrugge and protect British naval activities in the English Channel and North Sea. The raid went badly wrong with the Marines, tasked with capturing German shore based artillery batteries, taking heavy losses. During the action, William&rsquo;s platoon came under heavy fire. William was wounded and his officer killed. Despite being one of the younger soldiers in the platoon, and injured, he led a small group of marines to capture one of the batteries, preventing further fire on the ships and soldiers and saving many lives. William then led what was left of his men to safety by stealing a small boat and rowing, under fire, back to the ship which had brought them there.</p>\n<p>He was decorated with the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal for his actions.</p>\n<p>After the raid William was hospitalized and during his convalescence met Charles Cofton, an officer who had suffered terrible injuries in an accident with an artillery shell. Despite the fact Charles was officer and William was a young enlisted man, the two struck up a friendship which has lasted.</p>\n<p>The war was over by the time William made a full recovery but he elected to stay with the Marines and was nominated for the officer training cadre. Again, he excelled in training and passed out as a 2nd Lieutenant in 1920. He went on to serve with the Royal Marines in all theaters until November of 1937 when, after 21 years of service, he retired with the rank of Captain and a Meritorious Service medal to hang alongside his other gongs.</p>\n<p>Having been in the military all his adult life, William did not adapt well to civilian life. He squandered most of his savings and until recently had struggled to find work. In January of 1938 William was contacted by a Naval officer called Duncan McCoughie. McCoughie offered William a job, the chance to serve again, he accepted without hesitation. Now he carries out clandestine operations for the government under the direction of McCoughie. He still doesn&rsquo;t know what McCoughie&rsquo;s rank is, only that he has one, and William calls him Sir.</p>"},"species":{"name":""},"archetype":"","currency":"500","wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":3,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Novice","details":""},"bennies":{"value":3,"max":3},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":true},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":true},"token":{"disposition":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"displayName":0,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"name":"William Hopewell","actorLink":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"modules/jd-weird-world/images/archetypes/section-d-taster/William%20Hopewell.webp","actorId":null},"items":[{"type":"skill","name":"Athletics","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skills/jump-across.svg","data":{"description":"<div class=\"swade-core\">\n<p>Athletics combines an individual&rsquo;s coordin&shy;ation with learned skills such as climbing, jumping, balancing, biking, wrestling, skiing, swimming, throwing, or catching.

We&rsquo;re not talking about wiccans, white witches, hedge mages, or other magic users who draw their power from nature, themselves, or anything good. Use the blessed or shamans for those who walk on the side of light.</p>\n<h3>Black Magic</h3>\n<p>This Arcane Background features witches and warlocks who draw energy straight out of the darkest part of the Hunting Grounds. &ldquo;Black magic&rdquo; is a quick and easy source of power for those who learn to take it, and it&rsquo;s as tainted as week old meat. The Reckoners are happy to let mortals play with this power, even if they think they&rsquo;re ultimately doing good with it, because eventually it corrupts even the strongest wills.</p>\n<p>Since witches gain their power from black magic, they gain certain advantages when the Fear Level is 4 or higher, just like those practitioners of black magic under the Marshal&rsquo;s control:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Fear Level 4&ndash;5:</span> The witch gets a free reroll on any failed @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-skills.Spellcasting]{Spellcasting} roll.</li>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Deadlands:</span> The witch gets a free reroll on all Spellcasting rolls.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course those rerolls just give the witch more chances to become Corrupted, as we&rsquo;ll examine next!</p>\n<h3>Corruption</h3>\n<p>In addition to the usual effects of @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Fatigue]{Fatigue} and terminating all active powers, a witch who rolls a @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Trait Rolls]{Critical Failute} gains a point of Corruption. Each point of Corruption gives her a new Minor @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Hindrances]{Hindrance} or increases a Minor to a Major (her choice).</p>\n<p>Hindrances should be negative in nature. A witch might become excessively irritable (@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-hindrances.Mean]{Mean}), grow a large wart on her nose (@Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-hindrances.Ugly]{Ugly}), or even become @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-hindrances.Wanted]{Wanted} by the authorities.

This eliminates a Minor Hindrance she gained through Corruption, or reduces a Major Hindrance gained through Corruption to the Minor version.

Former GUGB trainee, Russian exile and shapeshifter.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Languages: </strong>Russian (Native), English, German, Cantonese</p>\n<p><strong> </strong><strong>Description: </strong>Anya Valtaya is a true enigma. At the age of 21 she has seen more of the world and its unsavory elements than many people twice her age. Behind her youthful looks and cat-like grace lies a maturity and demeanor born from a life of true hardship. Standing at 5&rsquo;10&rdquo;, Anya is tall and lithe. Her strawberry blonde hair frames a natural beauty somehow out of place with the functional Western clothing she typically wears.</p>\n<p><strong>Background:</strong> Taken from the streets of Ekaterinburg aged around three, she was given to Professor Ilya Ivanovich Ivanov to be a test subject. Ivanov, having made groundbreaking developments in artificial insemination with horses, made no secrets about his desire to create human/animal hybrids. His famous failed experiments in the late 1920s to inseminate chimpanzees with Human sperm were not his first attempt though. Anya, along with many other children, was part of a program organized by GUGB Department XIII. The experiment involved mixing genetic material in a living subject, many animals were involved. Wolves, tigers, orangutans and even eagles were tried. Anya was injected with the blood of a Snow Leopard.</p>\n<p>One by one, the test subjects died until only Anya remained. Although showing no sign of the genetic meld having worked, she remained alive, and in captivity. Aged around seven (nobody knows her actual birth date) she began a program of specialist training including languages and physical conditioning. She was a natural athlete and as her dexterity and strength grew, she was taught combat techniques, the theory of infiltration and information gathering. Then, years after the infusions of snow leopard blood had ceased, and several years after the death of the man himself, one of Ivanov&rsquo;s experiments worked.</p>\n<p>As she entered adolescence, Anya noticed changes in her physical abilities. She became able to transform her body at will, to manifest beastly characteristics, claws, teeth, incredible strength and speed. Married to her ongoing training as an assassin, she was now a formidable asset for the NKVD and, in particular, the GUGB Intelligence division.</p>\n<p>The NKVD took an intense interest in Anya&rsquo;s condition but with Ivanov having died in 1932 they no longer had the skills or knowledge to recreate his gene melding technique. A new team of biologists was assembled with orders to identify and extract Anya&rsquo;s ability from her cells and transfer it into new test subjects. Although her training and conditioning continued, she was subjected to horribly painful procedures and treated as nothing more than a lab rat. A few months ago, after around five years in &ldquo;The Academy&rdquo;, she rebelled.</p>\n<p>Killing her captors and fleeing &ldquo;The Academy&rdquo;, she headed west. Her espionage skills and natural, almost innate, ability to hunt, kept her one step ahead of her pursuers. In Berlin, with both the NKVD and Gestapo breathing down her neck, she entered the British Embassy and requested political asylum. After an extraction operation orchestrated by the SIS she found herself in London, a young lady with a peculiar skill set, who owes more than a few favors to the British for getting her out of Berlin alive.</p>\n<p>Anya was made a one-time offer by the SIS. They were setting up a new unit specifically for espionage and sabotage operations. If she joined them, she just might have the opportunity to get some revenge on those who had treated her so badly.</p>"},"species":{"name":""},"archetype":"","currency":"500","wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{"value":15,"max":15},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":3,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":4,"rank":"Seasoned","details":""},"bennies":{"value":3,"max":3},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":true},"token":{"disposition":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"displayName":0,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"name":"Anya Valtaya","actorLink":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"modules/jd-weird-world/images/archetypes/section-d-taster/Anya%20Valtaya.webp","actorId":null},"items":[{"type":"skill","name":"Athletics","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skills/jump-across.svg","data":{"description":"<div class=\"swade-core\">\n<p>Athletics combines an individual&rsquo;s coordin&shy;ation with learned skills such as climbing, jumping, balancing, biking, wrestling, skiing, swimming, throwing, or catching.

He drew his gun, more out of fear than out of any desire to use it. The quiet voice of Smoke filled the darkness and the alley. It was everywhere, echoing and filled with menace. “Guns are useless, Kreel. You should know that you can’t shoot...Smoke.” Kreel fell to his knees and dropped his gun as the laughter again filled the alley.<br/> The weed of crime bears bitter fruit, and the masked avenger intends to ensure it tastes very bitter indeed. While some characters thrive on their reputation – on being known – the masked avenger thrives on being unknown. His weapons are rumor and superstition, his cloak secrecy. The masked avenger represents those “normal” men who use their abilities at stealth and disguise to terrify the cowardly and superstitious criminals that they face, giving them a superhuman edge over their much more numerous opponents.<br/> Crime in the Pulp Era was often brutal, and brutal methods were sometimes necessary to fight it. A vigilante who deals with criminals too powerful or strange for the police, the masked avenger is a weird figure who uses terror, darkness and (usually) blazing twin .45’s to deliver justice and hot lead to the guilty. While a predecessor of the super-hero, the masked avenger’s costume usually consists of a dark suit, a trench coat or cape, a fedora and a domino mask or concealing bandana, though more outlandish and garish costumes have been known.<br/> Due to their lethal methods, masked avengers were often as persecuted by the police as they were hated by the underworld, hence the need for a secret identity. Masked avengers often faced gangsters and mad scientists, but their investigations frequently led them into conflict with stranger and darker adversaries, such as vampires, ghouls and black magicians. While most masked avengers used theatrical tricks and special effects to terrify their opponents, some used psychic gifts and mesmerism to achieve their aims.<br/> While some masked avengers are motivated by tragedy, the majority are simply trying to do the right thing. Many are wealthy young men (very rarely women) who have decided to put their natural gifts and extensive resources to the service of justice – as opposed to the Law. The masked avenger is a staple of the Pulp genre. Examples include the Shadow, the Spider and the Black Bat.<br/> Quote:“Crime does not pay!” BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!

The gumshoe’s life is hard and often grimy, but it’s never boring.<br/> While the Pulps did feature examples of rogue private eyes who’d branched out into blackmail, theft and even murder, by far the majority were bound by a deeply ingrained sense of justice and a personal code of honor.<br/> A private detective with his own business will need to find suitable office space and advertise. On the other hand, he can also set his own fees. The private detective’s relationship with the local police may be one of mutual respect or complete antipathy.

She dresses to impress and is never without an opportunity for a gentleman to behave properly. Whether that is a cigarette to light, a door to be held open or a drink to be paid for.</p>\n<p>All business with her fellow agents, Nancy's demeanor changes like the sky on a windy day when she is working a mark or playing a part to further the needs of king and country. She follows orders to the letter and always stays on task.</p>\n<p><strong>Background:</strong> Born in 1912, Nancy Watson was an Orphan by the age of five. Her father, an infantryman, died at Passchendaele, and her mother of Spanish Influenza a few months later. Nancy was taken into a government run orphanage where her intelligence and wit soon came to the attention of the board of governors. They made sure Nancy went to a good school and from there she was recruited into an academy for \"Girls with special potential\". Knowing she was, more or less, alone, Nancy decided at a young age that if she were to have a better life then she would need to fend for herself.

Still, his eyes twinkle with a fierce intelligence and, though it doesn&rsquo;t move as quickly as it once did, his body still shows signs of Drum&rsquo;s boxing history. Drum is a gentleman and always wears a suit and a hat. His only vice is his pipe often gripped firmly between his teeth.</p>\n<p><strong>Background: </strong>William Balgaire Gordain Fyfe was Born in 1883 in Calcutta, the son of a member of the foreign office. He was educated in Scotland at Robert Gordon's College in his father&rsquo;s home town of Aberdeen, and St. Andrew's University.</p>\n<p>In his youth he was a strapping lad and keen sportsman, sharp of mind, and a consummate tinkerer &ndash; forever playing with one project or another. It was one of these 'projects' (attempting to repair and fire one of the muskets on display in the great hall) that earned him the nickname he uses to this day.</p>\n<p>After getting caught red-handed with his repaired musket, one of the masters uttered two words &ldquo;Musket, Fyfe?&rdquo; The story goes that after his punishment was doled out, one of young William&rsquo;s classmates told him he had just earned his nickname. William was pleased, being known as William &ldquo;Musket&rdquo; Fyfe was surely a good thing? &ldquo;He took that cane and beat your arse like a drum,&rdquo; said his friend, &ldquo;so that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to call you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>At St. Andrew's, Drum studied Sciences and Engineering and also boxed for the University. His schooling was broad rather than deep though as his mind would flit from project to project, becoming something of a Jack-of-all-Trades but master of none.</p>\n<p>After graduating, Drum stayed on at St. Andrew's as a researcher but when the Great War broke out he volunteered like so many other young men. Drum&rsquo;s education saw him selected for the Royal Engineers and they in turn sent him to Sandhurst for officer training. Ultimately he joined the corps as a 2nd Lieutenant and turned his hand to knocking down many of the things his education had taught him to build. These days he talks little of his experiences during the Great War, often getting a faraway look when others speak of their wartime escapades.</p>\n<p>After the war Drum focused his efforts on communications technology. He believed better communication would have meant far better organization and thus, a war won more swiftly and with a much reduced human cost. His communications research would lead him to trouble.</p>\n<p>He came to the attention of the SIS in late 1937 after being kidnapped by Nazis intent on forcing him to work on a scientific project for them. The SIS team sent to extract Drum found him sitting next to a pile of unconscious guards, smoking his pipe.</p>\n<p>While he secretly feels he may be a little old for field work these days, he refuses to back down from a challenge, believing the benefits of his knowledge and experience far outweigh the physical failings that have come upon him as age begins to take its toll.</p>"},"species":{"name":""},"archetype":"","currency":"500","wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":3,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Novice","details":""},"bennies":{"value":3,"max":3},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":true},"token":{"disposition":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"displayName":0,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"name":"William Fyfe","actorLink":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"modules/jd-weird-world/images/archetypes/section-d-taster/William%20Fyfe.webp","actorId":null},"items":[{"type":"skill","name":"Academics","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skills/graduate-cap.svg","data":{"description":"<div class=\"swade-core\"><p>Academics reflects knowledge of the liberal arts, social sciences, literature, history, archaeology, and similar fields.

Then it turned out your dad actually was some kind of investing genius as those companies were soon bought out by a major search engine corporation, and suddenly you had to hire people to count your money.<br/> You keep thinking the whole thing is going to fall apart at any moment, and so while the money is here you’re going to college like you wanted. ETU was the only school to even look at you seriously when you didn’t have money, so despite being able to go anywhere you wanted it was the only place for you.<br/> You wanted to keep a low profile and your money secret, but your new roommate blabbed it all over campus claiming you two were best friends.

Occult investigators tend to regard the forces of the arcane as impersonal and amoral, as simple expressions of the natural (and supernatural) world, rather than spiritual beings with intentions and motivations of their own. Occult investigators are prone to lengthy, rambling explanations of magical phenomena, but usually possess the most open minds, preferring to approach each new case as if it had an entirely mundane origin.<br/> Occult investigators rarely use magic directly but may occasionally use protective circles and other simple wards or protective devices. Usually they use their knowledge of the laws of magic, rather than using magic itself – a subtle distinction, but an important one.<br/> Occult investigators such as Thomas Carnacki, Anton Zarnak and Jules De Grandin use a blend of arcane science and psychic mastery to overcome genuine intrusions of the unknown into the everyday world.<br/> Quote:“Stay within the circle!

With nothing more serious to do than plan the next party or the next seduction, the gentleman crook has turned to crime to provide the ultimate thrill or to right some perceived wrong.

Rarely does he steal from those who cannot afford the loss, and his spoils are often donated to the poor or those in need, giving him a “Robin Hood” reputation. Many gentleman crooks prefer to steal only from those who it is felt deserve it; criminals, corrupt politicians or just people with appalling taste and bad manners.<br/> Some gentleman crooks operate under an assumed identity, while others are known but rely on their great skill to avoid being caught.

I hate heights.<br/> – from the Journals of Malcolm Gideon Part archeologist, part researcher, part adventurer, the relic hunter explores ancient and unknown ruins, seeking treasures from the past, either in the form of ancient artifacts or forgotten wisdom. Relic hunters may be motivated by a desire for personal fortune and glory, or by an altruistic desire for what they find to expand the boundaries of knowledge and be available for all to see. Sometimes, it’s a little of both.<br/> Relic hunters, while tough and independent, also work well in teams. They’re specialists and recognize the need for expertise in other areas. They’re often found in company with explorers, big game hunters and air aces.<br/> The villainous relic hunter is another Pulp Era staple. In this character the desire for knowledge has become an obsession, eroding their morals and humanity as they fight to be the first to obtain some secret treasure. These individuals are often little more than tomb robbers, holding little respect for the cultures they encounter and caring nothing for the furthering of human understanding. As such, they’re often found in the company of mercenaries, Femmes Fatale, Evil Masterminds and Nazis.<br/> Quote:“We are simply passing through history.

Technology expert and former soldier</em></p>\n<p><strong>Languages: </strong>English (Native),French, German, Italian, Morse Code</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> Charles Cofton is essentially a cripple. His right arm and right leg were damaged beyond repair in an accident in the First World War and he now has mechanical replacements which he made himself. He also carries a scar to his face which runs brow to chin separating piercing blue eyes. He usually wears loose fitting trousers and a linen shirt beneath an old sheepskin pilots jacket to hide his mechanical arm and leg. A faint whirring sound accompanies Charles wherever he goes.</p>\n<p><strong>Background:</strong> Charles was born in London in 1892 to wealthy parents, Charles and Violet Cofton. Charles Cofton Senior worked in the banking sector in London and was able to afford a fine house and a good education for his only child. Charles Junior attended Harrow and then Oxford where he studied Engineering.</p>\n<p>Upon his graduation in 1913 Charles was accepted into Sandhurst as an officer cadet and passed out with a commission as a Second Lieutenant in June 1914. He was posted to the Royal Artillery and within a few months was sent to France at the outbreak of war.</p>\n<p>Charles' Engineering skills were put to use and he was tasked with creating more powerful artillery shells. When experimenting with a new shell in 1916 there was an accident. The shell exploded in the breach of a gun it was too powerful for. The explosion ripped away much of the right side of Charles' body but somehow, he survived. His right arm and leg were amputated, but he lived and returned to England to convalesce. In May of 1918 he met William Hopewell, an injured Royal Marine Lance Corporal. The two struck up an unlikely friendship with Charles being an officer and William an enlisted man, but the friendship lasted.</p>\n<p>Stripped of two of his limbs but unbroken in spirit, Charles began to work out how to mend his broken body. The war ended in November of 1918 but Charles' personal battle was ongoing. In 1920 he traveled to Switzerland and learned clock and watch making.In 1922 he made a clockwork arm and hand enabling his work rate to accelerate. In 1923 he made a clockwork leg and walked for the first time in seven years. He was whole again.</p>\n<p>Charles spent many years traveling the world learning new technologies and techniques and always he used the knowledge to grow stronger, faster and more capable. Since 1923, Charles has made significant improvements to his prosthetic limbs, even enhancing their performance. These days the arm and leg function as one unit replacing most of the right side of Charles&rsquo; body.</p>\n<p>In 1936, Charles was contacted by his old Commanding Officer and asked if he would undertake an information gathering mission in Nazi Germany. Charles accepted the mission and traveled to Germany where he saw first-hand the advances the Wehrmacht were making. Since then, Charles has undertaken several missions for the SIS, most recently at the request of former naval officer Duncan McCoughie.</p>\n<p>Notes: If Charles loses his prosthetic limbs he has the One Arm Hindrance and his Slow Hindrance becomes Major until he repairs or replaces the limbs.</p>"},"species":{"name":""},"archetype":"","currency":"500","wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{"value":10,"max":10},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":3,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":4,"rank":"Seasoned","details":""},"bennies":{"value":3,"max":3},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":true},"token":{"disposition":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"displayName":0,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"name":"Charles Cofton","actorLink":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"modules/jd-weird-world/images/archetypes/section-d-taster/Charles%20Crofton.webp","actorId":null},"items":[{"type":"skill","name":"Athletics","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skills/jump-across.svg","data":{"description":"<div class=\"swade-core\">\n<p>Athletics combines an individual&rsquo;s coordin&shy;ation with learned skills such as climbing, jumping, balancing, biking, wrestling, skiing, swimming, throwing, or catching.

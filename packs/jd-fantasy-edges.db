Additionally, they don’t worry about sins, though they have to deal with occasional “strain.” Strain: Troubadours who roll a 1 on their Perform die, regardless of the Wild Die, suffer the effects as for a minor sin (–2 to Perform for a week). Should they critically fail such a roll, they suffer the effect of a major sin (complete loss of powers for a week and –4 to “normal” uses of the Perform skill). This represents terrible strain on their voice, mind, or raw nerves for the given period. The Perform skill may also be used simply to entertain instead of activating powers. In these cases, the Troubadour can earn money for his performance. A successful skill roll per “set” (usually a couple of hours) nets him $1d6 for every 10 members of the audience. Double this number with a raise. The performer may add his Charisma to the roll when using the skill in this way. This assumes the audience can tip instead of a set fee. The audience may also tip with libations, livestock, blind dates with their daughters, or local rumors that may lead to adventure, fortune, and glory.","notes":"Eberron Conversion page 33","additionalStats":[],"isArcaneBackground":false,"requirements":{"value":"Novice, Arcane Background (Miracles), Perform d6+"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"UeH4lLk57wAOn2HV":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.eberron.tXKOs906BfOsenRF"},"cf":{"id":"temp_55h04g4ex3n","path":"Eberron","color":"#000000"}},"_id":"IRU2eGKzTwGPDLKX"}

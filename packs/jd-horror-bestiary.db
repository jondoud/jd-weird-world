After an artillery barrage or an infantry charge, many soldiers looked alike- covered in mud or dust, identical in their kit and uniforms, and all with hardened expressions indistinguishable from the rest. In the trenches, it was even worse, with many brigades all suffering from the same disease and filth. For the most part, only the pilots in the air and the high commanders themselves could lay claim to vibrant individuality even in the midst of battle. Some wanted to take advantage of this issue and turn it into a weapon. A special task force of Allied soldiers discovered an abandoned lair filled with bizarre scientific gear, a seemingly random selection of restraints, and- most terrifying of all-several half-formed featureless humanoid bodies floating in gray-green tanks. Papers in the laboratory proclaimed it to beone of Dr. Hochmueller's (see page 76) attempts to create a soldier whot could take on the appearance of the enemy. The extent of Hochmueller's success is unknown, but the creature described in his notes as a \"Der Spiegelgeist\" (or \"mirror-ghost\" in English) has been encountered many times since. Soldiers conflated the names to call the horrors \"mirrorgeists.\" Mirrorgeists have a doughy, unfinished look in their natural form, their flesh pale and nearly translucent. The things rarely spend any time in their natural form, preferring to ambush a soldier, kill him, and take his place with none the wiser. A mirrorgeist can alter the appearance of its flesh-and even its height and weight—to more closely match its intended target. Thus disguised, mirrorgeists take great pleasure in seeking out the victim's closest friends and comrades, killing them, and gaining strength from their essence.

Hellstromme began manufacturing them in the earliest days of the Great Rail Wars, and they've proven remarkably effective at their intended task-killing people—ever since. Roughly humanoid in shape, automatons are constructed out of ghost steel and rely on sophisticated hydraulics to move. Unlike the earliest models, these mechanical abominations are powered by a combustion engine fueled by a mixture of ghost rock and gasoline, providing them with enormous power if a somewhat reduced continuous operation time. Usually equipped with highly-restricted machine guns or occasionally flamethrowers, they are rarely encountered off Hellstromme Industries properties, at least outside of Deseret. The enigma of the automatons-that they're actually guided by a zombie brain-is one of Hellstromme's best-kept secrets. On the rare occasions that one of these abominations is actually defeated in combat, the device invariably explodes, hiding the evidence of the true horror behind its manufacture.

This force's mission was to attack and destroy a Turkish force occupying the region, but things went quickly awry-and weird. The 5th Battalion of the Norfolk Regiment was part of the Allied force, given orders to assault a hillside near Suvia Bay. The soldiers dutifully ascended the forested hill and entered what looked to be a low-lying cloud bank. That was the last anyone saw of them that day. The disappearance of the Royal Norfolk Regiment was a mystery for some time, until months later when they were spotted again. They appeared during a battle on French soil, stepping out of an early-morning fog near the German lines. The men wore the Norfolk uniforms but were clearly changed. They were cruel and brutal fighters, attacking with no mercy and little care for their own wounds. The Norfolk Reavers, as they are now known, always appear when there is a mist, cloud, or fog, screaming and charging with reckless abandon at the enemy. Allied soldiers bless the appearance of the Norfolks, but they are an unstoppable tidal wave of death for the troops of Central Powers. The Reavers appear for a single assault when things seem most desperate for British, Australian, or New Zealand troops. They fade from the world when the enemy has fallen or the round after being dealt a Joker.

Some of these bootleggers decided to give their bathtub gin an extra kick by filtering it through ghost rock, hoping to sell a few extra cases on novelty if not necessarily flavor. The drawback to this hooch-called \"red rum\"—is that on top of the usual risk of going blind, sometimes the drinker turns into a rampaging abomination! The vast majority of the time, a person with this affliction lives his life normally. But during times of great stress he changes into his monstrous form and is driven to commit acts of mayhem and violence. Any time a person who suffers from this malady draws a face card for his initiative, he transforms into a Hyde. Of course, as Marshal, you're also free to inflict the change whenever works best for your adventure! Hydes possess an animal-like cunning. They take delight in violence and the pain of others and hold little loyalty to anyone but themselves, often lashing out at their closest friends and loved ones.

They come in all sizes and shapes, mainly because they're able to alter their body almost at will (although this doesn't change their Size for game purposes).

With a casual glance, only a Notice roll (–4) can spot anything amiss with one of these swarms when it's camouflaged. However, any character who's specifically looking for a mass of bugs disguising themselves as a human (for whatever reason) can roll a Notice roll with no modifiers.

Bloodflies impregnate human flesh with their spawn, burrowing deep into the human body to lay their eggs. Most often, this means the insects slither into the brain before spawning, an act most often leaving the host debilitated or slain outright. Survivors face an even more dire threat a few days later when the bloodfly's larvae chew their way to freedom through the host's skin. A bloodfly swarm is a deadly foe to encounter on the battlefield. The effects on troop morale are the most dire because the sight of insects bulging up beneath a comrade's skin as they burrow toward his head is a nightmarish image. Even more so are the terrifying deaths when the larvae spawn from holes in the unfortunate soldier's face should he survive the initial attack. The German forces initially used bloodflies as a form of area denial attack, leaving hives of these creatures sealed in metal canisters for the Allies to stumble across in southern Ypres. The deployment of these terror weapons staggered the Allies for a time. However, a secret mission was quickly organized to foil the German scheme to use bloodfly swarms in other theaters of war. Dozens of such canisters were destroyed by fire during the raid. In retaliation, the Germans deployed the chlorine gas originally stockpiled as an insect cleansing agent but now use directly against the British lines instead.

They're a subtle abomination that seeks to corrupt the souls of mortals, leading them to damnation. These monsters favor the innocent, but are happy to deal with anyone willing to bargain with them. Folks interested in making a deal with the Devil, so to speak, can summon these abominations through a variety of rituals. The demons aren't picky; they respond to virtually any such ceremony. The most popular-at least in the South—usually revolves burying some sort of personal trinket around remote rural crossroads, often at midnight, hence the creatures' name. In return, the crossroads demon asks for only a small part of the bargainer's soul. These demons gladly offer strength, power, love, wealth, or just about anything else the summoner requests. The \"gift\" is usually delivered subtly within a few days or weeks. Riches may come in the form of a lucrative contract, an inheritance, or rarely finding some sort of treasure. A Trait may take a few days or weeks to raise to avoid rousing suspicions among friends or family. Atonement: A character can recover his Spirit die (and maximum die type) by acts of great atonement. This is up to the Game Master, but should generally be one die type per genuine sacrifice of some sort, or two for a major and life-altering one. Slaying a crossroads demon has no effect on any bargain it may have made, by the way.</p></div>"},"species":{"name":"Crossroads Demon"},"currency":0,"wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{"value":0,"max":0},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":3,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Bestiary","details":"<ol class=\"savagedus-advances\"></ol>"},"bennies":{"value":2,"max":2},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":true},"token":{"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","name":"Crossroads Demon","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":0.25,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"actorId":null},"items":[{"name":"Fighting","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":10,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"dsiy2i449xqpe7r8","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Intimidation","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":10,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"4qq8coaqatg0d8f2","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Knowledge (Occult)","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":8,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"ok9w2vtmspg32bwm","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Notice","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":6,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"elyfkssqfhnqfjrn","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Persuasion","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":8,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"4nd6n3oh833xk56v","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Shooting","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":6,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"8ouv3nyliadlvptv","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Stealth","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":8,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"o5yhupq8u28vdvzd","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Taunt","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":8,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"b4ctnpx25rfudpod","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Charismatic","type":"ability","subtype":"special","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Charisma +4.

The possibility of encountering poisonous gas is a terrible fact of life, a nightmarish reality of bubbling skin and hacking lungs. And as if the gas itself weren't horrifying enough, reports claim there are creatures made from or perhaps drawn to the stuff, stalking the poisonous clouds looking for those who somehow survived it. These beings appear as fellow soldiers, clad in long, vulcanized trenchcoats and wearing gasmasks. Upon closer examination, however, it becomes apparent these figures move in an unnatural way, almost floating rather than walking like a solid man. Should a survivor come to grips with the thing, he finds the creature lacks an internal skeleton. Its limbs move in completely alien ways, able to bend to cringe-inducing angles. On their own, these beings are survivable by a well-trained soldier-they are not particularly strong or tough. They are relentless, however, and they often strike when a victim is already struggling with the effects of a gas attack. The clammy feel of rubber gloves wrapped around a soldier's throat can certainly be deadly. The greatest danger of these creatures pose is due to being made from such noxious mixtures. Killing one causes the \"soldier\" outerwear to rupture, unleashing the gas within as a deadly cloud. These gas terrors must be destroyed at range before they can close in on their victims-once the gas-masked monsters have reached a soldier's throat, it's usually far too late.

Most commonly used in an encampment, the clarion call of the bugle was sounded as warning and triumph, to herald a victory or mourn those whose lives were lost in battle. Sometimes, however, the bugle calls were more sinister than comforting. Instead, they were far more…weird. Seen (and heard) only at night, the spirit or spirits known as the phantom bugler have appeared in almost every region involved in the Great War. These spirits appear as young soldiers, buglers by their uniforms, but they are clearly not normal. The spectres are somewhat transparent, have a slight glow to their outlines, and cause chills to run up the spine of any who encounter them. The phantom bugler's notes are more sinister still. Their musical signals are often used to lure units of soldiers into danger, either by calling for them to advance into an artillery barrage or signaling a retreat at the most disastrous moment. The music of the phantom bugler can lead to madness, especially if it is repeated night after night over an encampment of soldiers. The horrors thrive upon fear and the chaos they sow, but suffer greatly when faced by a person who has conquered his fear.

Their mouths are filled with needle-like teeth and their fingers end in long, raking claws. Few ever see the true visage of a lamia however, as the creatures appear as incredibly beautiful women, or less frequently, strikingly handsome men. Lamias' physical appeal can become so great as to be almost overpowering to those attracted to their gender. Only heroes with tremendous willpower can even hope to attack a well-fed lamia, much less defeat it! Most of these abominations gravitate toward roles in society where their unnatural presence not only helps them succeed, but also provides them easy access to large numbers of potential prey. This enables them to spread their feeding out over more victims and thus hide the negative effects. As a result, these monsters are often found pursuing careers in politics, entertainment, and similar professions.</p></div>"},"species":{"name":"Lamia"},"currency":0,"wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{"value":0,"max":0},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":3,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Bestiary","details":"<ol class=\"savagedus-advances\"></ol>"},"bennies":{"value":2,"max":2},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":true},"token":{"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","name":"Lamia","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":0.25,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"actorId":null},"items":[{"name":"Fighting","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":8,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"6k25fh4d6c8wlgqx","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Notice","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":10,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"vkv2s7bnpfljffti","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Persuasion","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":12,"modifier":2},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"9p9skrte1xccqyqe","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Stealth","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":8,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"et0vtvxg6cakil4q","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Streetwise","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":10,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"cuaohafu9mblk1ou","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Charismatic","type":"ability","subtype":"special","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Charisma +4.

A German \"dead zeppelin\" many thought shot down and destroyed early on in the conflict, the Graf Schmidt was launched by the navy in 1915 and reported lost in early 1917. However, stories persist that the airship continues to fly over the battlefields of WWI, visible only at night and crewed by the dead. The prow of the Graf Schmidt is painted with a distinctive shark's mouth pattern. Its tether lines drag below it, twisting against the wind like unnatural tentacles. The windows on the gondolas are shot out and broken, and there are long, ragged tears in the hull, defying logic and revealing skeleton-like ribs within. The captain of the ship is Schmidt himself, a powerful and mad spirit focused on destroying the Allied forces that struck him down months earlier. Area Appearing: Western front. Acc/Top Speed: 2/44; Toughness: 16 (0); Crew: 18 (Commander, 2 pilots, navigator, wireless operator, bombardier, 4 mechanics, 4 riggers, 4 gunners), +2d6 other damned souls who serve as guards. Notes: Aircraft, Climb -2. Flight range is seemingly limitless. Armament: 6 pintle-mounted MG08 machine guns on top, 2 forward gondola, 2 rear gondola, tail (each has limitless ammunition) Ordnance: 3,500 lbs. of bombs.

US Marines, French, and British soldiers advanced through the mist-shrouded trees only to be cut down by German machine guns. Fixed bayonets tore open throats, grenades flew into hasty trenches, and both sides suffered enormous casualties as the battle ebbed and flowed. The bloody assaults woke something ancient in Belleau Wood-some dark and primeval force. There are some who claim the forest was once a Gaulish burial ground for a murderous tribal chieftain. Others believe it may simply retain the fears of the soldiers who died there, pooling the rich essence of terror until it takes on physical form. In that wood, and during that battle, the teufelhunden were born. There are many stories of what happened during the battle, but the most famous-and most classified—tale involves a distinctive question…and its dark answer. As the fighting shifted along the Allies' front lines, Gunnery Sergeant Dan Daly rallied his men. The US Marine's words rang out through the trees: \"Come on, you sons of bitches, do you want to live forever?\" In response, some of the fallen soldiers began to rise, chanting an answer in eerie unison: \"Yesss…yess, we do.\" Those who survived the final hours of the battle for Belleau Wood describe seeing creatures resembling slain men, wearing uniforms from both Allied and German forces but somehow transformed into dire, wolf-like beings with glowing green eyes. The creatures' death wounds oozed black, tar-like ichor, and their faces were nearly unrecognizable in their new, bestial aspect. Shrill howls erupted through the woods and the creatures-dubbed \"devil dogs\" in the aftermath-loped after any soldiers who remained behind. Tooth and claw were not the creatures' only weapons either; many had kept or looted rifles from the dead and proved they had not lost their marksman skills from their former lives. At the battle's conclusion, both Allied and German forces retreated from the wood. Commanders on both sides have serious reservations about any planned return. The devil dogs (or teufelhunden-a garbled German translation) remain within Belleau Wood, the trees there cloaked in thick fog ever since. Some believe the teufelhunden guard something inside the wilds, perhaps protecting the Gaulish chieftain's barrow or some locus of great evil. None know for sure, but Belleau Wood harbors only one apex predator beneath its boughs-the \"hounds of hell.\" Area Appearing: Western

Most of the time the grave is under water, but during a drought it dries up and Bloody Jim returns, appearing as he did at death. Bloody Jim carries his head in one hand and in the other a sharp hook used for dragging logs onto the saw mill conveyor.

Even well-trained, disciplined soldiers fall prey to this hunter, a beast known as the Hound of Mons. It is a giant, skulking hound that lurks amongst the corpses and shell holes of no man's land, feeding on human flesh and possessing a cruel, cunning mind. The howl of this malicious hound strikes fear into the hearts of many soldiers manning the trenches, shaking even the morale of veterans who were capable of facing death with a smile. A lean, gray wraith, the Hound of Mons is infamous for ghosting through barbed wire and sentries almost at will. It is a silent and patient hunter who evades every trap set for it-for the Hound is far more than a simple animal. It has been theorized that the Hound is nothing more than a once-loyal dog, now gone feral amidst the madness of no man's land and the grinding trench war. However, some papers have come to light describing certain experiments by a German scientist, Dr. Hochmueller (see page 76). The procedures described in Hochmueller's notes involve surgical transplants of a human brain-formerly belonging to a madman—into the corpse of a huge dog. The papers describe the doctor's careful excision of areas of the brain concerning hatred and frenzy, implanting these brain slices into the body of a Siberian wolfhound. Some question the veracity of these papers, and the many similarities of Dr. Hochmueller's theories to those of a much older scientist-Dr. Frankenstein. Whatever the truth, the Hound of Mons is a chilling reality to the soldiers on the front lines of the Great War. Any patrols venturing into No Man's Land have more to fear than shells and machine guns…they also fear the howl of the Hound of Mons.

An evil clown might appear near a circus and lure attendees into a dark tent where it can devour them.\nDream evils never attack their host, that automatically ends their existence. The only way to be rid of them is to survive seven straight nights without sleep, or via the banish entity power.\nDream evils have physical statistics based on their form.

Eventually, the Rangers and the Agency succeeded in destroying the last of those \"night trains,\" leaving many of the undead trapped in the vastness of the Western deserts and plains by the creatures' greatest foe: the sun. Eventually, some of those creatures sought the protection of the earth to escape the sun's burning rays. Over time, these undead have evolved into the subterranean, burrowing nightmare called diggers. Diggers are completely blind, and in fact, no longer even have eyes. Instead, they have developed a finetuned sense of hearing and touch that allows them to hunt their prey from under the surface, dragging them beneath the soil often before the victims realize what's happening. Even above ground, their preternatural senses function almost like passive sonar, able to detect even the slightest noise with amazing precision. These creatures look like bald, emaciated humans. Their eye sockets are not only empty but completely overgrown with flesh. Coarse, brown claws sprout from their fingers and toes, and chisel-like incisors protrude from their withered lips. Although they rarely speak, when they do it is limited to a sibilant, hissing growl.</p></div>"},"species":{"name":"Digger"},"currency":0,"wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{"value":0,"max":0},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":0,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Bestiary","details":"<ol class=\"savagedus-advances\"></ol>"},"bennies":{"value":2,"max":0},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":false},"token":{"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","name":"Digger","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":0.25,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"actorId":null},"items":[{"name":"Fighting","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":10,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"yqciyx8y8i1ywczt","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Intimidation","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":8,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"dilm73il67dbgril","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Notice","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":10,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"sgai16osnhkbx4h6","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Stealth","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":12,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"dpjl9ve8i9qrkh3d","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Blind","type":"ability","subtype":"special","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Immune to any attack reliant on sight.<p><cite>Deadlands Noir n/a</cite></p>","notes":"Immune to any attack reliant on sight.","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"rc7kbtohrx1bc7t4","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Burrow","type":"ability","subtype":"special","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"8\".<p><cite>Deadlands Noir n/a</cite></p>","notes":"8\".","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"fzo1tdn8dfa2xlog","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Drag","type":"ability","subtype":"special","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"With a raise on an opposed Strength check, a digger can drag its prey into the ground as an action.

A few souls decide to abandon the charnel fields but cannot escape through their own comrades or the lines to their front. This leaves them perpetually trapped in No Man's Land, hiding in small bands in abandoned trenches, collapsed supply points, ruined buildings, or more commonly, ancient tunnels beneath the battlefields. The Somme, it is said, with its hard chalk foundations, is riddled with such caves- and the violent bands of \"tunnel brood\" who hide within. Tunnel brood are not ghouls. Mostly they steal from the living or the dead as best they can and hoard it in their hidden lairs. Some, of course, stray from stealing to devour the occasional war horse, chow dog, or unfortunate cow killed by the constant warfare. Fewer still, madmen in every sense of the word, are all too willing to feast on the flesh of their fellow man. Tunnel brood dwell in loosely organized tribes, hiding beneath the surface between allied and enmy lines. They have renounced their citizenship-brood bands may consist of British, French, German, and even Colonial fugitives. Such bands are madly fierce and territorial, especially in defense of whatever hole they've taken residence in. Tunnel brood are most often encountered as patrols move through No Man's Land between battles, perhaps looking for wounded or carrying out quiet trench raids on their foes. That's when the fugitives are likely to spring a trap, particularly if they outnumber the regulars by 2 to 1 or more. The War Master should roll a die when tunnel brood are encountered. If the result is odd, the brood are mad and murderous. If the result is even, they simply want to take the trespassers' possessions-especially food and ammunition. They'll only murder if they feel the patrol is likely to return with reinforcements to wipe them out.

As the war grinds on and grows weirder, some pilots believe certain dark cloudbanks are harbingers of doom. This particular belief began not long after the start of the war, when a routine patrol of French planes flew through a series of clouds and emerged on the other side with two planes missing. None of the other pilots had heard any gunfire, but the casualties were blamed on enemy action. It was a British pilot who first caught a glimpse of the creature behind the disappearances. He described seeing a massive, lizard-like bird creature, its leathery skin the same gray color as the clouds. The creature dove down onto another plane in his formation and snatched the pilot right out of the cockpit with its talons, holding the struggling, tiny figure and flapping off to vanish within a building thunderhead. The pilot's story was difficult to believe, but when his wingman's plane was recovered, there were clear signs of massive clawmarks upon the fuselage. Some believe the dawn of air war has awakened these fearsome creatures. The cloud hunter has a 40-foot wingspan and a mottled gray, leathery hide that helps it blend in with clouds of nearly every type. The creature has a distinctly reptilian appearance, with a long, narrow maw filled with razor-sharp teeth and two nimble, clawed feet equipped with swordlike talons.

One of the most feared is the man-portable flamethrower, a device that ignites petrol in a burning spray of rolling flame. Intended to flush out enemy trench lines, flamethrowers are terror weapons- and often as dangerous to the wielder as to its intended targets. A single stray bullet, misaligned pipe, or poor maintenance schedule could result in turning the operator into a human torch a stumbling, screaming candle of fleshy tallow. In certain rare cases, soldiers on the Western Front have watched fellow soldiers erupt into flames when the flamethrower apparatus failed or was damaged-and then turn on his former comrades in a frenzy of fiery destruction. These victims are somehow transformed into murderous blazing corpses, able to move, fight, and see normally despite being wreathed in flames and oily black smoke. Sometimes called \"burning men\" or \"cracklers,\" the most common name for these monsters is \"torchwalkers.\" Torchwalkers lie dormant like walking dead when there are no living beings to ignire. When they eventually detect their prey, they spring to unlife, ignite, and bring grim death to those who stumbled upon them.

It cannot affect the physical world in any way.\nFetches are invisible, but occasionally, at the Game Master's discretion, mortals might catch a glimpse of the creature.</p></div>"},"species":{"name":"Fetch"},"currency":0,"wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{"value":0,"max":0},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":0,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Bestiary","details":"<ol class=\"savagedus-advances\"></ol>"},"bennies":{"value":2,"max":0},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":false},"token":{"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","name":"Fetch","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":0.25,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"actorId":null},"items":[{"name":"Fighting","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":6,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"gkts8tzy72cxz0sy","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Notice","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":10,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"aqpf7rkmrfgw387s","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Stealth","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":6,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"ycfyhstkxjlnb00f","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Dire Warning","type":"ability","subtype":"special","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"When a fetch detects an invisible or ethereal foe within about 20 yards (10&#x201d; on the table-top), its host gains a vague sense of the enemy's location as well.

These \"plasmoids\" seem nearly mindless, attacking the nearest prey no matter what uniform it wears. The blobs avoid daylight, seeping into shell craters and tunnels during the day.

In general, hoarfrost warriors are most likely to be found in these regions. However, the power of the curse upon them may send hoarfrost warriors onto any seacoast where the temperature drops below freezing.\nWhen these entities appear, they approach the shore in long, dark boats which are nothing more than silhouettes in the night. The hoarfrost warriors silently glide across the waves from their shadowy craft and into unsuspecting towns, spreading havoc and death throughout the settlement.\nOn occasion, these spirit raiders claim live victims and take them aboard their ethereal longboats. Invariably, they choose male victims for hostages. Legend claims that these spirits do so to  ll holes in their own number, turning the victim into a hoarfrost warrior himself through some unknown process.\nThese ghosts are invisible except in moonlight. There, they appear as translucent, hulking Norse warriors with pale white skin accented by pale blue veins and hair.

From a distance, they appear to be humanoid. Nearer, one can see the silver sheen of their scaled skin. The mouths of these creatures are gaping and piscine,  filled with sharp, translucent teeth. Most remarkable of all are their glistening, metallic eyes which never blink.\nTravelers have claimed sighting ancient cites occupied by these  sh-men in lonely stretches of the sea. Perhaps these lost megalopolises were even built by the icthynites themselves.\nIf so, the secrets to their ancient civilization are long lost, for the feral  sh-men seem to  have no recollection of it. Instead, they clamber over the neglected ruins,  fighting each other and feeding on any mortals that dare wander close to their abodes.\nIcthynites are capable of breeding with human women. Usually, any offspring born to a human parent is horribly deformed. Few of these survive even the first moments of life. Over the years, a small number have been born with none of their inhuman father's traits and have integrated into human society. Most have\nno idea of their unnatural parentage. Those offspring that survive, as well as their own descendants, have hidden ancestral memories deep within their souls. For this reason, the  sh-men croon from the sea at night, recalling all mortals who can remember their alien song. Should any wander towards the waves, they are taken from the shore and into the deep below to never be seen again.\nWe don't recommend you apply this fate to heroes.

These creatures are tiny, man-shaped, and sometimes take on the rough appearance of their creators. The recipes for homunculi vary from alchemist to alchemist and often vary greatly. However, all have one thing in common: even though they are somehow granted a spark of life, these strange constructs lack a soul.\nThis fact makes homunculi extremely dangerous for they are perfect vessels for demonic or other types of spiritual possession. Few escape falling prey to the attentions of fell beings, often within hours, or even minutes, of their creation. Ironically, since most alchemists fancy themselves scientists rather than magicians, the majority of them scoff at the possibility of such an event.\nWhile in service of their creator, these creatures are typically used for innocuous purposes, or at worst, to spy on others.

With their last breathe they cursed their god and their comrades, unintentionally binding their spirit to the killing ground. They manifest as small handfuls of flickering white flame that is oddly cold to the touch rather than hot. Some soldiers claim to have seen a grinning face inside a will o' wisp. A will o' wisp uses the glimmering light produced by its form to lure its intended victim to a secluded spot. Appearing to be a wounded man waving a flashlight or lighter, the wisp favors the stretcher teams it blames for its death. Once they approach, it weakens its victims with a fire seeming to spring from Hell itself. Once the target succumbs to the heat, the ghost possesses his corpse which immediately bursts aflame. These burning zombies are sometimes referred to as \"flaming jacks.\" The ghost uses the reanimated body to wreak as much havoc as it can before it is consumed by the creature's otherworldly flames- usually against the other members of the litter team now. Initially, a will o' wisp haunts the area near its death, seeking vengeance on its former comrades. Once it has revenged itself, the hatred and anger that drove it to an undead existence continue to burn within the ghost. Some areas of No Man's Land flicker with small lights once night falls over the blasted landscape. In these areas, litter teams often request chaplains to accompany them to perform \"last rites\" when they head out at night to recover the wounded following an offensive. The light of a will o' wisp varies from cold white to flame orange. The ghost can lessen its brilliance to that of a mere candle or brighten it to that of a torch at will.

The catch is once a cadaver has been underwater for a month or more its flesh begins being replaced by a substance scientists and doctors call adipocere. Less learned sorts call it corpse or grave wax-which you have to admit is a lot more colorful term. When a manitou latches onto one of these waterlogged corpses, the end result is a bit different from the run-of-themill walkin' dead. Being submerged in water for long periods of time does all sorts of unpleasant things to a carcass. Grave wax is lighter and bulkier than the fat it replaces, lending a grotesque bloated appearance to the body, hence the common name of this type of walkin' dead. Undead of this sort also have grayish-white flesh and an odor distinctly different from old-fashioned zombies, not unlike old, moldy cheese. Bloats, by the nature of their transformed flesh, are particularly resistant to puncture wounds, including those caused by bullets. Arrows, bullets, and the like find little resistance in the abominations' waxen bodies and pass harmlessly through them. However, alcohol acts like acid on the creatures, dissolving them wherever it comes in contact. These undead are usually found in the Maze, the bayous of the South, and large rivers, but are possible anywhere a body may have been submerged in water for long periods of time. Although they frequently come ashore (or clamber onto boats) to attack the living, they usually return to their watery graves sooner or later.</p></div>"},"species":{"name":"Bloat"},"currency":0,"wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{"value":0,"max":0},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":0,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Bestiary","details":"<ol class=\"savagedus-advances\"></ol>"},"bennies":{"value":2,"max":0},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":false},"token":{"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","name":"Bloat","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":0.25,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"actorId":null},"items":[{"name":"Fighting","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":6,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"0sbtfurre2nisx3c","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Intimidation","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":4,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"rerdl18emi5uea68","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Stealth","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":6,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"xr4kluqnkitv81qn","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Swimming","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":6,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"e2ft4u2mvqo4agm9","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Tracking","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":6,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"a37v8ebkfc5uvv0e","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Claws","type":"ability","subtype":"special","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Str<p><cite>Deadlands Noir p.p119</cite></p>","notes":"Str","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"oweg9pi65qg5wbk5","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Fear –1","type":"ability","subtype":"special","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Their distorted features make bloats more frightening than other walkin' dead.<p><cite>Deadlands Noir p.p119</cite></p>","notes":"Their distorted features make bloats more frightening than other walkin' dead.","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"if24go2y7di9agvn","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Fearless","type":"ability","subtype":"special","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Bloats are immune to Fear and Intimidation.<p><cite>Deadlands Noir p.p119</cite></p>","notes":"Bloats are immune to Fear and Intimidation.","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"we723bei69rhitvo","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Puncture Resistant","type":"ability","subtype":"special","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Bloats take half damage from most firearms and piercing weapons.

It attacks victims with two straw-like fangs, which allow the beast to suck the blood from its prey. Like the yeti and Loch Ness monster, chupacabras are cryptids-rare, non-supernatural creatures not recognized by science. The chupacabra prefers the tropical rain forests of Central America, but ranges throughout the Caribbean, South America, and the southern United States. Chupacabras stand roughly three feet tall when upright on their hind legs and are fearsome creatures to behold. A canine head rests upon a simian-like body covered in short, sharp quills. The chupacabra can change the color of these porcupine-like quills to provide camouflage, making it an especially dangerous predator under the right conditions. A row of longer quills runs the length of the beast's back.</p></div>"},"species":{"name":"Chupacabra"},"currency":0,"wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{"value":0,"max":0},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":0,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Bestiary","details":"<ol class=\"savagedus-advances\"></ol>"},"bennies":{"value":2,"max":0},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":false},"token":{"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","name":"Chupacabra","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":0.25,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"actorId":null},"items":[{"name":"Athletics","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":8,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"euwt3qsn21llndcc","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Fighting","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":8,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"h6vebx5tscix1hji","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Healing","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":4,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"xg9pev2z5goad40m","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Notice","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":6,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"jn9zt0yhopaawgt5","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Stealth","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":8,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"i4wbm4jgptety9xy","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Bite / Claw","type":"ability","subtype":"special","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Str +4<p><cite>ETU p.p83</cite></p>","notes":"Str +4","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"9pvug6p047s0eabs","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Chameleon Coat","type":"ability","subtype":"special","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"The chupacabra's quills can change color and texture to adapt to its surroundings.

Most of the reanimated corpses encountered, even in the Crescent City, are walkin' dead. Even the quickanddirty creatures animated by the bokkor using the zombie power are just short-unlived walkin' dead. Zombies, on the other hand, are the big guns of the Red Sect-and they are far more rare. Creating a zombie takes considerable preparation. The bokkor begins working on his victim long before the poor sucker checks into a graveyard, administering a combination of arcane poisons and ritual curses. After the victim dies, the ritual process continues over the next three nights at the soon-to-be undead juggernaut's burial site. Given the popularity of the necropolises in New Orleans, pulling those nightly ceremonies off undisturbed is no mean feat! Once reanimated, zombies are virtually invulnerable, hideously strong, and incapable of betraying the bokkors' wishes. While the abominations do have a couple of obscure weaknesses, one is impossible in the heat of combat and the other isn't even feasible out of sight of the ocean. Other than dismemberment or completely consuming the undead body by fire- something that takes several hours-zombies are almost unstoppable once given a command, which is usually to kill. In general, the only way to defeat one of these monsters is to catch it while it is inert or trap it in a stone or concrete room sufficient to withstand its terrible strength.</p></div>"},"species":{"name":"Zombie"},"currency":0,"wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{"value":0,"max":0},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":0,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Bestiary","details":"<ol class=\"savagedus-advances\"></ol>"},"bennies":{"value":2,"max":0},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":false},"token":{"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","name":"Zombie","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":0.25,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"actorId":null},"items":[{"name":"Fighting","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":8,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"c7jkaycoka6rd6ig","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Fists","type":"ability","subtype":"special","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Str.<p><cite>Deadlands Noir p.p129</cite></p>","notes":"Str.","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"csu4kw2atioqlo1o","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Fearless","type":"ability","subtype":"special","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Zombies are immune to Fear and Intimidation.<p><cite>Deadlands Noir p.p129</cite></p>","notes":"Zombies are immune to Fear and Intimidation.","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"5arklmgq8sm6fly3","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Improved Arcane Resistance","type":"ability","subtype":"special","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Zombies gain a +4 bonus to all Trait rolls to resist magical effects.

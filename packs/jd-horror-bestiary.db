They do so by plunging the victim into a terrible and all-too-real dream world. Within, the dreamer must battle to complete some quest, overcoming obstacles and defeating foes, or remain lost in the nightmare land forever.\nDreamreavers often pull close companions of their victims into the nightmare realm as well. This means an entire party might find themselves trapped in one of their companions' nightmares.\nOnce in the dream world, the victim soon stumbles upon some quest that he feels compelled to complete. The task may be simple escape, it may be to defeat a dread foe, or it may to reach some distant objective.\nThe foes and obstacles faced along the way are very real (within the dream world, anyway), and should be handled just as in regular play.\nVictims who die within the dream world remain in a coma in the physical world. They are essentially brain dead, the dreamreaver has devoured their essence.\nThose who survive and &#x201c;win&#x201d; dispel the dreamreaver and are blessed with restful sleep for the rest of their lives.

They say Jim bullied the rough mill crews just as he had done every other man who had crossed his path, right up ‘til the day he picked a fight with a lumberjack called Big Harold and was thrown into the sawmill's whirling blade. His old crew unceremoniously buried him nearby in a muddy slough. When Jim's head parted from his shoulders that should have been the end of it, but his restless, angry spirit wasn't done. Most of the time the grave is under water, but during a drought it dries up and Bloody Jim returns, appearing as he did at death. Bloody Jim carries his head in one hand and in the other a sharp hook used for dragging logs onto the saw mill conveyor.

When this happens, which it often does, the machine spirit &#x201c;falls in love&#x201d; with the driver, killing at night or when the operator isn't present to avoid the temptation of devouring him or her instead.

Some take the form of demonic clowns, others as tentacled beasts or maniacal versions of abusive parents. Regardless of form, all are intent on manifesting in the physical world and causing as much mayhem as possible.\nDream evils materialize after their host has gone to sleep, generally appearing within a few miles and proceed to act something like what they've manifested as. A giant spider lurks in trees and ensnares victims, however.

The only way to be rid of them is to survive seven straight nights without sleep, or via the banish entity power.\nDream evils have physical statistics based on their form. Their Smarts and Spirit are equal to the Spirit of the host. They also have the following Special Abilities.</p></div>"},"species":{"name":"Dream Evil"},"currency":0,"wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{"value":0,"max":0},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":3,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Bestiary","details":"<ol class=\"savagedus-advances\"></ol>"},"bennies":{"value":2,"max":2},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":true},"token":{"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","name":"Dream Evil","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":0.25,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"actorId":null},"items":[{"name":"Nightmare Entity","type":"ability","subtype":"special","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Dream evils exist only as long as their host sleeps.

The hoarfrost warriors silently glide across the waves from their shadowy craft and into unsuspecting towns, spreading havoc and death throughout the settlement.\nOn occasion, these spirit raiders claim live victims and take them aboard their ethereal longboats. Invariably, they choose male victims for hostages. Legend claims that these spirits do so to  ll holes in their own number, turning the victim into a hoarfrost warrior himself through some unknown process.\nThese ghosts are invisible except in moonlight.

From a distance, they appear to be humanoid. Nearer, one can see the silver sheen of their scaled skin. The mouths of these creatures are gaping and piscine,  filled with sharp, translucent teeth. Most remarkable of all are their glistening, metallic eyes which never blink.\nTravelers have claimed sighting ancient cites occupied by these  sh-men in lonely stretches of the sea. Perhaps these lost megalopolises were even built by the icthynites themselves.\nIf so, the secrets to their ancient civilization are long lost, for the feral  sh-men seem to  have no recollection of it. Instead, they clamber over the neglected ruins,  fighting each other and feeding on any mortals that dare wander close to their abodes.\nIcthynites are capable of breeding with human women. Usually, any offspring born to a human parent is horribly deformed. Few of these survive even the first moments of life. Over the years, a small number have been born with none of their inhuman father's traits and have integrated into human society. Most have\nno idea of their unnatural parentage. Those offspring that survive, as well as their own descendants, have hidden ancestral memories deep within their souls. For this reason, the  sh-men croon from the sea at night, recalling all mortals who can remember their alien song. Should any wander towards the waves, they are taken from the shore and into the deep below to never be seen again.\nWe don't recommend you apply this fate to heroes. Being the ancestral offspring of a degenerate race of  sh-men is probably something a player shouldn't learn about as a result of a random Trait check!</p></div>"},"species":{"name":"Icthynite"},"currency":0,"wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{"value":0,"max":0},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":0,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Bestiary","details":"<ol class=\"savagedus-advances\"></ol>"},"bennies":{"value":2,"max":0},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":false},"token":{"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","name":"Icthynite","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":0.25,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"actorId":null},"items":[{"name":"Climbing","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":6,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"8it1g7x8wxl1rbde","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Fighting","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":8,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"zjo5w3rpf79d1mbe","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Notice","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":8,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"85lwp2d2hu4csnzt","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Stealth","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":8,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"zx5jynhp6vngy4ab","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Swimming","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":12,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"uw8hhkpjsp3qitbe","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Aquatic","type":"ability","subtype":"special","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Pace 8<p><cite>Horror p.p94</cite></p>","notes":"Pace 8","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"g7q3sbyss9dirkxe","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Armor +2","type":"ability","subtype":"special","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Icthynites have tough scales.<p><cite>Horror p.p94</cite></p>","notes":"Icthynites have tough scales.","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"gipm6pqdz2c6ll3x","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Blood Frenzy","type":"ability","subtype":"special","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"When another character or animal suffers a wound, all icthynites within 6&#x201d; are driven into a frenzy by the scent of blood.

Ironically, since most alchemists fancy themselves scientists rather than magicians, the majority of them scoff at the possibility of such an event.\nWhile in service of their creator, these creatures are typically used for innocuous purposes, or at worst, to spy on others. Under the control of a malevolent spirit, they become focused on mischief and mayhem, or far worse.\nInitially, the appearance of these small constructs depends largely on the ingredients used in their manufacture. Some appear plant-like, while others may vaguely resemble lizards or other reptilian creatures. Over time, they may take on more human features as they bond to their creator, or more demonic ones if they succumb to diabolic influences.</p></div>"},"species":{"name":"Homonculus"},"currency":0,"wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{"value":0,"max":0},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":0,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Bestiary","details":"<ol class=\"savagedus-advances\"></ol>"},"bennies":{"value":2,"max":0},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":false},"token":{"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","name":"Homonculus","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":0.25,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"actorId":null},"items":[{"name":"Climbing","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":6,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"402ny02vycgtf64y","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Fighting","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":6,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"2lzr60y7r7xmqmoa","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Notice","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":6,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"t2bbq4orwmjrhuzu","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Stealth","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":10,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"4c4bf50o147h5nos","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Claws","type":"ability","subtype":"special","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Str<p><cite>Horror p.p92</cite></p>","notes":"Str","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"1d462uxou9wym86j","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Malleable Body","type":"ability","subtype":"special","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"A homunculus can squeeze its body through any space at least 1 inch in diameter.<p><cite>Horror p.p92</cite></p>","notes":"A homunculus can squeeze its body through any space at least 1 inch in diameter.","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"8jnbg798ggyenyjn","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Noxious Breath","type":"ability","subtype":"special","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"A homunculus can exhale a small cloud of gas that works as a very mild sedative.

It attacks victims with two straw-like fangs, which allow the beast to suck the blood from its prey. Like the yeti and Loch Ness monster, chupacabras are cryptids-rare, non-supernatural creatures not recognized by science. The chupacabra prefers the tropical rain forests of Central America, but ranges throughout the Caribbean, South America, and the southern United States. Chupacabras stand roughly three feet tall when upright on their hind legs and are fearsome creatures to behold. A canine head rests upon a simian-like body covered in short, sharp quills. The chupacabra can change the color of these porcupine-like quills to provide camouflage, making it an especially dangerous predator under the right conditions. A row of longer quills runs the length of the beast's back.</p></div>"},"species":{"name":"Chupacabra"},"currency":0,"wealth":{"die":6,"modifier":0,"wild-die":6},"conviction":{"value":0,"active":false},"autoCalcToughness":false,"autoCalcParry":true},"powerPoints":{"value":0,"max":0},"fatigue":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2},"wounds":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":0,"ignored":0},"advances":{"value":0,"rank":"Bestiary","details":"<ol class=\"savagedus-advances\"></ol>"},"bennies":{"value":2,"max":0},"status":{"isShaken":false,"isDistracted":false,"isVulnerable":false,"isStunned":false,"isEntangled":false,"isBound":false},"initiative":{"hasHesitant":false,"hasLevelHeaded":false,"hasImpLevelHeaded":false,"hasQuick":false},"additionalStats":{},"wildcard":false},"token":{"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","name":"Chupacabra","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":0.25,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"actorId":null},"items":[{"name":"Athletics","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":8,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"euwt3qsn21llndcc","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Fighting","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":8,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"h6vebx5tscix1hji","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Healing","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":4,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"xg9pev2z5goad40m","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Notice","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":6,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"jn9zt0yhopaawgt5","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Stealth","type":"skill","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/skill.svg","data":{"description":"","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"attribute":"","isCoreSkill":false,"die":{"sides":8,"modifier":0},"wild-die":{"sides":6}},"_id":"i4wbm4jgptety9xy","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Bite / Claw","type":"ability","subtype":"special","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"Str +4<p><cite>ETU p.p83</cite></p>","notes":"Str +4","additionalStats":{},"subtype":"special","grantsPowers":false},"_id":"9pvug6p047s0eabs","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}},{"name":"Chameleon Coat","type":"ability","subtype":"special","img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/ability.svg","data":{"description":"The chupacabra's quills can change color and texture to adapt to its surroundings.

Work with your GM to determine what circumstances may trigger your hero’s powers. When a power is triggered, it is automatically cast (with the normal skill roll and spending Power Points as normal) as a free action, with targets and other power‐specific choices made by the GM. If your hero attempts to suppress the power, make a Spirit roll (counting as an action on your next turn if you’re in combat), with modifiers as the GM feels appropriate for the circumstances; this may need to be done repeatedly if the circumstances still apply on later rounds. Remember that this is a Hindrance; if you want the power to go off, it’s still an action for you to use it as normal – it only activates as a free action if you don’t want it to.","notes":"Summoner's Circle page 7","additionalStats":{},"major":true},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"UeH4lLk57wAOn2HV":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.summoners-circle.WiPkGCq27xGyAWZ4"},"cf":{"id":"temp_f55k9icw4b9","color":"#000000"}}}

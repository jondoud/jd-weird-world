Name,Benefit,Source,Requirements,
Hard,"Maybe it’s willpower. Maybe it’s muscle density. Or maybe your hero’s just one tough bastard. Either way, he adds +1 to his Toughness.",Deadlands Noir page 12,"Novice, Spirit d8+"
Hardboiled,This bruiser is tougher than shoe leather baked in the Sahara. He adds +2 to his Toughness.,Deadlands Noir page 12,"Veteran, Hard"
Hedonist,"Your character can binge on his vice to quickly recover some Power Points. This requires him to overindulge in his bad habit (which takes 10 minutes’ worth of time). A grifter addicted to alcohol, for example, might chug half a bottle of whisky. A smoker might cough up a lung going through an entire pack in 10 minutes. Or a gambler might risk way more cash than he can afford on a single roll of the dice with someone who must definitely be paid. Whatever the binge, when it’s over, the grifter recovers 1d6 Power Points.</p><p>The bender comes with a price—the hedonist suffers Fatigue until he can rest up for at least four hours. The grifter can repeat the trick unless he’s Exhausted (he cannot Incapacitate himself).",Deadlands Noir page 11,"Novice, Arcane Background (Grifter), Smarts d8+, Spellcasting d8+"
Hitman,"This hitter isn’t your average mook. She’s got a knack for putting her shots where they count. When she rolls a raise on a Shooting attack roll, she gets a bonus 1d10 to damage instead of the usual 1d6.",Deadlands Noir page 12,"Veteran, Agility d6+, Smarts d6+, Spirit d8+, Shooting d8+, Stealth d8+, Streetwise d6+"
Moxie,"Your gumshoe can cut a mook down to size with a few sharp words, or turn a goon’s threats into a laughing matter with only a sentence or two. Your hero gets a +2 to all Taunt rolls and can use Taunt in place of his Smarts or Spirit when resisting a Test of Wills.",Deadlands Noir page 12,"Novice, Smarts d6+, Taunt d8+"
Sleuth,"Your flatfoot has a knack for spotting things most other folks—even the cops—miss. You can spend a Benny to have your character find any and all relevant clues in a scene, no roll necessary.",Deadlands Noir page 12,"Novice, Smarts d6+, Notice d6+"
Talented,"You’re gifted. In fact, you might even be good enough to make a living at it, kid! Choose a Performance specialization each time you take this Edge. You get +2 to all your rolls with the chosen specialization. Also, in general, you’re able to find a nightclub or theater willing to give you the stage once a week. Whenever you do, you earn $5 x the total of your skill roll in box office receipts, cover charges, and/or tips.</p><p>This Edge doesn’t guarantee you fame. That, you still have to earn the hard way.",Deadlands Noir page 12,"Novice, Performance d6+"
Veteran Of The Concrete Jungle,"A Veteran of the Concrete Jungle has been walking the mean streets for a while now. She’s done a lot and seen more. She starts at Seasoned Rank, which means she has four Advances to spend immediately after character creation.</p><p>Such experience comes with a price, though. If you decide to take this Edge for your shamus, draw a single card from the Action Deck and show it to the GM. He’ll compare it to the table on page 50 to see what your hero faced in the past. Be warned—the results can be extreme, ranging from serious maiming to insanity.",Deadlands Noir page 11,"Wild Card, Novice, Occult d6+"
Virtuoso,"You’ve got the kind of talent that can make you famous. Choose a Perform (Specialization) in which you already have the Talented Edge. You gain an additional +2 to all rolls with that skill. On top of that, you’re able to occasionally book gigs that bring in the big bucks, but no more often than once a month. This gig earns you $10 x the total of your skill roll. The rest of the month, you’re stuck doing club acts and the like, but hey, twenty bucks is twenty bucks. Like Talented, this Edge doesn’t ensure your performer is going to be famous, but it sure helps!",Deadlands Noir page 12,"Novice, Performance d10+, Talented"

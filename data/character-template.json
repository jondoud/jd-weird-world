They subtract 4 from their Faith rolls and from their Agility and Agility-based skill rolls if using medium or heavy armor or shields. Druids cannot use metal armor at all.</li>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Nature Bond:</span> A druid may attune herself to nature or a special animal companion.

Those drawing energy from divine sources must uphold the principles of the Nature Domain. <br />If the druid violates her deity's trust (GM's call) the druid subtracts 2 from Faith rolls for a week. Truly sacrilegious acts might rob her of her powers entirely until she atones in some way.</li>\n<li><span class=\"list-heading\">Wilderness Stride:</span> Druids pass through terrain such as dense forest, rocky hills, or desert sands with ease.

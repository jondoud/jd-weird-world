LEMURE
The least of devilkind, lemures are shapeless masses of quivering flesh. These tortured souls bear little resemblance to whatever they once were.

XILL
Evil and alien, these flame-red humanoids are a strange mix of insect and reptile, with four arms and fanged mandibles.</p><p>Xills have only one purpose: to perpetuate themselves at the expense of others. All xills are female and capable of fertilizing their own eggs, but they require living hosts as incubators. A xill injects eggs into paralyzed victims via a grotesque ovipositor behind their mandibles. They prefer phase spiders as hosts.</p>,<p>Xills are the scourge of the Ethereal Plane.

"Ailin'","Your cowpoke suffers from a chronic and at least so far incurable disease of some sort. The Minor version of the Hindrance means you subtract 1 from any roll made to resist Fatigue from any source. Subtract 2 if it’s a Major Hindrance.</p><p><b>Source: </b>Deadlands The Weird West, page 15","Deadlands The Weird West, page 15",true
"Angst","Dark, brooding heroes and heroines suffer from depression, loneliness, and constant fatalism. It’s harder for them to see the light at the end of the tunnel, and so suffer –2 to Smarts rolls made to recover Sanity.</p><p><b>Source: </b>Horror Companion, page 3","Horror Companion, page 3",true
"Before You Die!","This character is compelled to reveal their plans before dispatching an enemy in some dastardly fashion. This happens in small scale encounters where the character believes he has an enemy at his mercy. If the character causes a Shaken, Vulnerable, Stunned, or Distracted effect on a foe, they must divulge some element of what they intend to do next, or reveal a part of their overall plan to their hapless foe, before attempting to put them out of the fight.</p><p><b>Source: </b>Secret Files of Section D, page 7","Secret Files of Section D, page 7",false
"Bleeder","Some individuals bleed much more freely than others. Maybe it’s an actual genetic condition, or maybe the victim is just unlucky and nicks a vein every time he gets stuck by some psycho with a knife.</p><p> Any time the victim suffers a wound that doesn’t Incapacitate him, he begins to bleed. Each round after suffering the wound he must make a Vigor roll or suffer a level of Fatigue that can lead to death. The bleeding can be stopped with a successful Healing roll, and is recovered at the rate of one level per hour afterwards—assuming reasonable food or fluids.</p><p><b>Source: </b>Horror Companion, page 3","Horror Companion, page 3",true
"Bullet Magnet","Sometimes a person just winds up in the wrong place at the wrong time. Some people seem to make a habit out of it.</p><p> This unfortunate soul is hit by accidental fire (using the Innocent Bystander rules) on a 1–2 for single-shot weapons, and a 1–3 for shotguns or full-auto fire.</p><p><b>Source: </b>Horror Companion, page 4","Horror Companion, page 4",true
"By the Book","You follow the rules, even when it’s against your best interest. You follow proper protocols at all times. This has good and bad points – on the plus side, you’ve got a +2 bonus to Spirit rolls to resist influences that might distract you from your duties. The downside is that you’re a stickler for following written instructions and official policy – if you disobey the orders of a superior officer, breach the rules of your organization, or even skip the boring paperwork, the Game Master can decide that it costs you bennies.<p><b>Note:</b> Cannot be taken with the Impulsive Hindrance.</p><p><b>Source: </b>Pulp Fantastic, page 76","Pulp Fantastic, page 76",false
"Combat Shock","Some people freeze up when things get dangerous, and your hero is one of them. It could be due to fear, flashbacks, or something else; whatever the reason, in the first round of any combat, you must make a Fear check. If you have the Major version, this roll is at -2.</p><p><b>Source: </b>Horror Companion, page 4","Horror Companion, page 4",true
"Cursed","Your hero has done somebody wrong, either through past affiliation or dark, unspoken deeds. For each player character with the Cursed Hindrance, the GM starts with one additional Benny!</p><p><b>Source: </b>Deadlands The Weird West, page 15","Deadlands The Weird West, page 15",true

"Cursed","Your heroine crossed some dark power and has forever after been marked by its tainted touch.

"Dependent","The character has someone they care deeply for such as a family member, close friend, or lover and will do all they can to protect that person so long as they are able to.</p><p><b>Source: </b>Pulp Fantastic, page 77","Pulp Fantastic, page 77",false
"Depression","Your character’s emotional problems make the very act of living a chore. Symptoms include sleep problems (either oversleeping or insomnia), severe procrastination (to the point that the sufferer may find it hard to hold down a job), and a lack of interest in anything. With anti-depressant drugs (limited to opioids and amphetamines during the Pulp era) there is no penalty, and this is a Minor Hindrance. Without drugs this is a Major Hindrance and characters suffer a −2 to most tasks and tend to avoid getting involved. A life-threatening crisis or shock may snap the character out of it for a while, but when the crisis is over, the character sinks back into inactivity afterwards. <p><b>Note: </b>Characters with this Hindrance during the Pulp era are at risk of becoming addicted to their medication (a Major Habit Hindrance), as non-addictive anti-depression drugs won’t be discovered until the 1950s.</p><p><b>Source: </b>Pulp Fantastic, page 77","Pulp Fantastic, page 77",true
"Disowned","Your hero did something shameful or scandalous in the past, bringing disgrace or embarrassment on your family. As a result, you have been disowned. Your family refuses to acknowledge you, and your hero’s starting Status is modified by –1.</p><p><b>Source: </b>Rippers Resurrected, page 14","Rippers Resurrected, page 14",false
"Doubting Thomas","Besides the description presented in Savage Worlds, Doubting Thomases are just not prepared to deal with the mind-twisting realization that these horrors could actually be real. Characters with this Hindrance suffer an extra point of Sanity loss (see page 22) when failing a Fear test. On the plus side, they start with a Sanity of +2. These changes only apply if you’ll be using the mechanics introduced in the Setting Rule Sanity (page 22).</p><p><b>Source: </b>Horror Companion, page 4","Horror Companion, page 4",true
"Glass Jaw","Your hero hates fist fighting, and for good reason. He’s no good at rolling with the punches and is often easily beaten. <p>When the Glass Jawed hero is fighting an unarmed enemy, all successful hits affect him one way or another. Any hit which does not Wound or Shake your character makes him Distracted instead. Once any sort of weapon is drawn against him, this hindrance is ignored.</p><p><b>Source: </b>Secret Files of Section D, page 7","Secret Files of Section D, page 7",false
"Grim Servant O' Death","Your hero’s a killer.  +1 to every damage roll he ever makes. Anytime his attack roll is a Critical Failure, he hits the nearest ally in sight with a raise! </p><p><b>Source: </b>Deadlands The Weird West, page 15","Deadlands The Weird West, page 15",true
"Heavy Sleeper","Once he drops off, he must make a Notice roll (−4) to wake up. He also suffers a −4 penalty to Vigor rolls made to stay awake.</p><p><b>Source: </b>Deadlands The Weird West, page 15","Deadlands The Weird West, page 15",false
"Jingoistic","This is the age of colonialism and belief in cultural superiority. The character dislikes people frm other cultures and believes his own traditions to be far superior. He cannot help belittling other cultures and praising the virtues of his own at every opportunity.<p>The hero subtracts 2 or 4 from Persuasion rolls when dealing with those of other cultures, and he may not use Leadership Edges on them.</p><p><b>Source: </b>Rippers Resurrected, page 14","Rippers Resurrected, page 14",true
"Jumpy","Every little thing makes this individual nervous and scared. Any time there’s a sudden noise, shock, or surprise, the Jumpy hero must make a Fear test.</p><p><b>Source: </b>Horror Companion, page 4","Horror Companion, page 4",false
"Love","The character is in love. As this is a Hindrance, it will be either a wild tempestuous destructive car crash type of a relationship, one that is not reciprocated by the other partner or a similar tragic and harmful situation, such as being in love with the spouse of a powerful political or criminal figure.<p>Whenever you have to choose between your head or your heart in situations involving the one you love, you must make a Spirit roll and score a raise in order to act as common sense or your head would dictate.<p>Naturally the Game Master will use this love in adventures in order to make your life difficult – for example, your love may become a villain and you’ll need those Spirit rolls to try and bring them to justice, or they may keep getting into situations that require you to abandon other activities and help them out, unless you make those Spirit rolls.</p><p><b>Source: </b>Pulp Fantastic, page 77","Pulp Fantastic, page 77",false
"Lyin' Eyes"," A hero with this Hindrance suffers a −1 penalty to all Intimidation and Persuasion rolls where lies—even little ones—must be told.  Also applies to Gamblling.</p><p><b>Source: </b>Deadlands The Weird West, page 15","Deadlands The Weird West, page 15",false

"Notorious","Your hero is renowned for being something of a rogue or scoundrel. People in the same social circle are wary of being too closely associated with such an individual for fear of being tarred with the same brush.<p>As a result, all costs are doubled for the Notorious hero when trying to call in a Favor (see page 34).</p><p><b>Source: </b>Rippers Resurrected, page 15","Rippers Resurrected, page 15",false
"Obsession","Your obsession consumes your life. It could be as small as a compulsion for cleanliness, order or justice, or it could be as grand as an insane scheme to wipe out humankind by igniting the atmosphere and then reseeding the Earth with your private menagerie of “improved” plant and animal species. Either way, it drives everything you do.<p>As a Minor Hindrance, it means you’ve got a compulsion of some sort, a nervous habit or obsessive tic like always washing your hands or always worrying about disease or demanding that you be the driver of any vehicle you travel in. It’s annoying, but not especially hard to handle. The GM might demand a bennie off you if you’re forced to overcome your compulsion As a Major Hindrance, your obsession drives everything you do. You’ve a +2 to any skill rolls related to accomplishing your obsession, but you find it hard to do anything that doesn’t further your crazy goal. This trait is really only suitable for NPCs and villains, but as always consult your GM prior to taking this hindrance.</p><p><b>Source: </b>Pulp Fantastic, page 77","Pulp Fantastic, page 77",true
"Old Ways Oath","Your hero has pledged to forego modern technology to honor the nature spirits. Those who remain true to their vows get a free reroll on any Spirit roll.</p><p><b>Source: </b>Deadlands The Weird West, page 15","Deadlands The Weird West, page 15",false
"Oversensitive","Your hero is high-strung, nervous, or otherwise of a sensitive disposition. Loud noises make him or her jump and silence is unsettling. The result of such a jittery nature is that your hero’s starting Reason is modified by –1.</p><p><b>Source: </b>Rippers Resurrected, page 15","Rippers Resurrected, page 15",true
"Screamer","No matter how much this hero fights it, fear and terror elicit an ear-splitting scream. The scream might alert other enemies, and it certainly unnerves the character’s nearby companions.<p>Any time the character fails a Fear test, she automatically screams at the top of her lungs. The worse the Fear modifier, the louder and longer the scream. Anyone within a Large Burst Template of the victim suffers a –1 to their Fear tests as well from the disturbing sound!</p><p><b>Source: </b>Rippers Resurrected, page 15","Rippers Resurrected, page 15",false

"Shell Shock","At the end of the War the character had horrific experience on the battlefield. This has left them with psychological scars, what in the modern world is known as PTSD (Post- Traumatic Stress Disorder). They often wake up screaming in the middle of the night, may experience flashbacks in response to stress, and must make a Fear check whenever an unexpected loud noise goes off.<p>In the Pulp era shell shock was poorly understood, and was often confused with cowardice. Officers on both sides of the trenches frequently executed men suffering from shell shock in the mistaken belief that they were weak and likely to desert.</p><p><b>Source: </b>Pulp Fantastic, page 77","Pulp Fantastic, page 77",true
"Slow","This character has cat-like reflexes—if the cat was dead and decayed, that is. He’s often slow to act in stressful situations—but just might be the first to die.</p><p> The victim draws two cards in combat and acts on the worst. If he draws a Joker, he uses it normally and ignores his Hindrance for the round.</p><p> Slow characters cannot take the Quick Edge, but they can actually improve their reaction time by taking the Level Headed Edge (but not during character creation). For this hero, Level Headed allows them to draw one card and act normally. Improved Level Headed grants them two cards and they act on the best of the two.</p><p><b>Source: </b>Horror Companion, page 4","Horror Companion, page 4",true
"Strange Visitor","Maybe you grew up in the jungles of the African Congo, or on an isolated plateau populated with dinosaurs, or in a vast cavern beneath the Earth’s crust colonized by the last survivors of fabled Mu. Whatever your origin, you’re not from around here. You’re a strange visitor in a different world to the one you knew. As a Minor Hindrance, you come from some another country or province with a very different culture, but not too alien. Your Skills are unaffected by these differences, but it’s unnerving and you occasionally run into more changes that you weren’t expecting.<p>The Major version of the Hindrance is only available with the GM’s permission; wherever you come from, it’s a very different place. You suffer a -2 penalty to any rolls dependent on familiarity with the cultures and technologies, and this penalty may be increased when trying to do anything dependent on advanced scientific knowledge or specialist training at the GM’s discretion.</p><p><b>Source: </b>Pulp Fantastic, page 77","Pulp Fantastic, page 77",true
"Supernatural Weakness","This hero has acquired a weakness to some material akin to those suffered by many of the monsters the Rippers fight. Perhaps your hero was cursed by a witch, or scratched by a monster in a previous encounter. Choose which weakness your hero has: Cold Iron, Wood, Silver, Sunlight, Salt, or Fire. You may take this Hindrance more than once, but you must choose a different weakness each time.<p>A hero with a Supernatural Weakness cannot use that substance and cannot stand to touch, or be touched by it. Weapons made from it inflict +4 damage on the hero.</p><p><b>Source: </b>Rippers Resurrected, page 15","Rippers Resurrected, page 15",false
"Talisman","The Talisman is a mental dependence on a physical item to use powers. The character suffers a −1 penalty to all arcane skill rolls if she doesn’t have it on her person. As a Major Hindrance, she suffers a −2 without it.</p><p><b>Source: </b>Deadlands The Weird West, page 15","Deadlands The Weird West, page 15",true

"Touched","Something happened to your hero. Something bad. Whatever it was robbed her of a little piece of her Sanity (see page 22). </p><p>As a Minor Hindrance, the character’s base Sanity is one point less than usual. As a Major Hindrance, it’s two points less.</p><p><b>Source: </b>Horror Companion, page 5","Horror Companion, page 5",true
"Trouble Magnet","Things never go smoothly for this hero. As a Minor Hindrance, whenever the character rolls a Critical Failure the consequences are subtly worse in some way, as determined by the Marshal. </p><p><b>Source: </b>Deadlands The Weird West, page 16","Deadlands The Weird West, page 16",true
"Victim","We’ve all seen the movies. Some lone hero or heroine is destined to survive while her friends are slowly picked off one by one. Your hero is one of the “unlucky ones.”</p><p> Anytime the group encounters a hostile threat and there’s no clear indication another individual should be the target, this character draws the short straw.</p><p> As a Major Hindrance, she’s the first target and all her Soak rolls are made at –1.</p><p><b>Source: </b>Horror Companion, page 5","Horror Companion, page 5",true
"Xenophobic","Whether because of simple racial intolerance or past dealings, the character has a dislike of all cultures other than his own and finds dealing with them unpleasant at best. He suffers a –2 penalty to Spirit when dealing with foreign cultures with the Minor version and –4 with the Major Hindrance. Openly voicing his xenophobic beliefs, something he finds hard to control, may lead to confrontation or ostracism.</p><p><b>Source: </b>Pulp Fantastic, page 77","Pulp Fantastic, page 77",true

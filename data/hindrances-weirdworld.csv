Bullet Magnet,"Some soldiers are just in the wrong place at the wrong time. This character makes a habit of it. This unfortunate soul is hit by accidental fire (using the Innocent Bystander rules) on a 1–2 for single-shot weapons, and a 1–3 for shotguns or full-auto fire. He’s also hit on a 1–2 under Heavy Fire (see page 34).",Deadlands Noir page 9,true
Corrupt,"Morals are just something at the end of a fairy tale to this loser. He’s always looking for a chance to better his own position, and the shadier the method, the better. He’s prone to taking bribes, selling out his clients and friends, and skimming a little off the top whenever possible. His Charisma takes a –2 penalty with anyone aware of his untrustworthiness, on top of any other problems his behavior is likely to generate for him.</p><p>In combination with Greedy, he can be bought by anyone for little more than the price of a cup of java.",Deadlands Noir page 9,false
Destitute,"Times are tough, and for your hero, they’re even tougher. Your character is a drifter or otherwise completely down-on-his-luck sad sack who’s lost everything in the Depression. Money runs through his hands like rainwater down a sewer grate. He starts the game with nothing but the clothes on his back. Destitute characters may not take the Comfortable Edge.",Deadlands Noir page 9,false
Lech,"Your shamus has a hard time keeping his gun in its holster, if you catch the drift. He tends to pay an unhealthy amount of attention to whoever attracts him and has a hard time turning down requests for help if he thinks it might result in an “encounter.”</p><p>He’s more than a little sucker for a spectacular pair of gams or big blue ones, and as a result, he suffers –2 to resist Persuasion in Tests of Will or Social Conflicts with those he’s attracted to.",Deadlands Noir page 10,false
Rebellious,"You’ve got a problem with authority figures: cops, mob bosses, bouncers, you name it. Whether you mouth off, actively disobey instructions, or just sit quietly and fume, your disrespect is blatantly obvious—and has the effect of getting you in hot water with the wrong people. Not surprisingly, this doesn’t do a lot to make you popular around the precinct house or courtroom. In addition to the obvious drawbacks, your hero has –2 Persuasion with respect to any person in a position of authority.",Deadlands Noir page 10,false
Schmuck,"Most folks are honest—at least in your mind. You tend to take a person at their word until they prove they can’t be trusted. Even then you’re likely to give them the benefit of the doubt. You’re taken hook, line, and sinker more often than a hungry catfish.",Deadlands Noir page 10,false
Short Temper,"Your character is more than a little touchy. He might not necessarily hold a grudge for long, but he’s got a short fuse and is likely to lose his composure at the slightest provocation. How he lashes out is up to you, of course, but he’s not one to suffer in silence! He’s also a sucker for any barbs thrown his way and subtracts 2 from all attempts to resist Taunt in a Test of Wills or Social Conflict.",Deadlands Noir page 10,false

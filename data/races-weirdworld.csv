"Clockwork Man","A Clockwork Man is a creation of science, a conglomeration of gears and machinery that duplicates the semblance of humankind. It is not a mindless automaton. Through some unknown means, it has been given the spark of life, intelligence, and free will. As genuine miracles of science, Clockwork Men are exceedingly rare but are becoming more commonplace in the largest cities.</p><p> • Construct: Clockwork Men add +2 to recover from being Shaken, don’t suffer wound modifiers, and are immune to poison and disease. Clockwork Men cannot heal naturally. To heal a Clockwork Man requires the Repair skill—which is used like the Healing skill, only with no “Golden Hour.”</p><p>• Fuel: During character creation, the player must determine the Clockwork Man’s power source (steam, wind-up, or experimental galvanic pile). If the Clockwork Man cannot access his power source at least once per day, he’s automatically Fatigued each day until he’s Incapacitated. The day after that, he goes “off-line” and must be revived with a Repair roll and a fresh charge of energy. The power source replaces the need for food and water.</p><p>• Made of Brass and Steel: The Clockwork Man is made of metal, which means it is effectively armored. +2 Armor (negated by AP weapons).</p><p>• Metal Man: Clockwork Men are somewhat resis- tant to harsh environments. They gain +2 bonus to resist all negative environmental effects (heat, cold, pressure, etc.)</p><p>• Outsider: Humans often treat Clockwork Men as just another machine. They subtract 2 from their Charisma when dealing with humans.</p><p>• Programming: Clockwork Men begin with a free d6 in one skill, representing their original programmed role.</p><p>• Unnatural: Arcane powers (magic), both detri- mental and beneficial, suffer a -2 penalty to affect Clockwork Men. This has no effect on damaging powers or Weird Science powers, which affect them normally.",modules/jd-weird-world/images/races/clockwork_man.png,The Widening Gyre page 10
